1034;Philip B. Meggs;male;https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1376380306p7/229491.jpg;I wrote the Brad trilogy irst. It began as a story called The Intruder. This was published in Mister magazine. I then sent it to the US where it was again published. The editor thought it would make a good novella. He also thought some sex wouldn't go amiss. There was no sex in Intruder. And so began my journey into erotica. The irst o the Brad trilogy novella was a hit. The other two soon ollowed.I'd been discharged rom the RN or being gay and there was nothing I could do about it. I then thought that maybe there was. I could write about gay sailors having lots o sex on ships. And boy would they have lots o sex. So that is why Brad became a sailor. And the satisying part the RN could do nothing about it. Yes sailors did have sex with each other and the Navy would have to live with it.Next came Virgin Sailors my irst published novel. It did well very quickly and another was asked or. I hadn't anything to give and had not really thought about it. I could only think that the Brad trilogy would make a good novel and suggested this. Publisher agreed and so Brad was born. It still remains my bestselling novel and 13 years on still sells.Writing a novel is hard work. Writing the next one is even harder. You just wonder i you can do it i you really want to do it. A blank page is a very intimidating thing. A blank page every day because that's what you start with is even more so.We all write in dierent ways. Some need to have a plan right down to how many words and chapters setting all the characters and the rest. I right rom the start have no idea what I am about to write. Yes I might have an idea o an ending or the start or something in the middle and oddly even a title but usually I've not a clue where the story will go. And so it was with Going Down.I'd hitched a lot in the navy to save money it was common back then and thought there might be a story there. You meet a lot o weird and wonderul people i you are lucky when hitching. You meet some scary ones too i you are not. And so Luke stepped onto my blank page and set o down the road. I've always ound it exciting wondering where I'd be taken and just as in real lie which path will be taken when the mind creates a crossroad o ideas. Beore I knew it he'd hitched rom Scotland to Dorset and met some very interesting people on his journey.I grew up in my beloved countryside and only ever spent a year o my childhood living in a dreadul town. Not quite true because I was born in London's East End and lived there until I was three. Thankully I recall little o it. Because o this my novels are set between on board ship and countryside romps. Another constant in my writing is humour. I my story has not made you laugh then I've only done hal the job. Fun and laughter is the lieblood o a ship's crew. When you have two hundred sailors living in the same tin can or months you will understand why. The other constant is sex. One o my avourite reviews was a guy who said he'd never laughed so much while sporting a boner and didn't know it was possible.With three novels selling well I began to believe I might have the makings o a writer. I was certainly enjoying writing and amazed mysel that I could write about sex so readily. And write about it I did in Riding the Big One when I sent Sandy to sea. Wall to wall or bulkhead to bulkhead sex it has been called the hottest gay novel ever. Not sure about that but I did have to stop a ew times when writing it.BRAD had done a couple o reprints and was selling well. He has always been special to me. I decided he needed another adventure. I would do a sequel. I called it Run Naked Run Free. I brought Brad home and away rom sailor buddies. He soon ound himsel in the company o his avourite sexy armhand Liam. What Brad did not know love was just around the corner by way o a delightul boy band singer. Beore he knew it he was smitten and in love on;Spain;Europe;7

1259;NOT A BOOK;male;https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1235608568p7/2125387.jpg;I grew up in Sheeld attended a variety o schools including Bedales in Hampshire and East Brunswick High in New Jersey. I went on to Sussex and Georgetown Universities where I read American Studies and started writing short stories. I joined the BBC in 1980 and worked on everything rom Crimewatch UK to a history o the Falklands War. I also did a spell in Enva Hoxha's Albania on a secret ilming assignment about an MI5/CIA mission there that went horribly wrong. In 1984 I was sent to Sri Lanka or the Real Lives series to report on the uprising against the Tamils and the diary I kept o that time became the basis or Perect Night. I moved on to Channel 4 where I was head o HistoryReligion and Features and indulged my passion or cars in several programme commissions. I also ound mysel in charge o Big Brother 3 the one that gave the world Jade Goody. Ater a brie oray into the brave new world o Yahoo (source o the sacking scene in Perect Night) I returned to TV as a reelancer but determined to write. Perect Night was the result. My two biggest inuences were and still are my wie Stephanie Calman (see Badmothersclub.com)and my agent Mark Lucas who showed what thriller writing was all about. Just Watch Me came about ater a bad day at Gatwick Airport discovering that my then ive year old daughter's passport had expired and instead o heading or Tobago I ound mysel in Durham where the only passport oice in the land would give me a replacement over the counter. Set in Britain Tobago and Aghanistan it tells the story o a man who loses his amily and has to go on the run while he tries to ind out why.My last two books Battleield 3 - The Russian (with Andy McNab)and Battleield 4 - Countdown to War have been written in association with Electronic Arts publishers o the Battleield global game ranchise. To EA's great credit they gave me the space to develop an autonomous story using some the games' characters and situations as launch pads or stand-alone narratives. You do not have to be a 'gamer' (I'm not - there I've conessed)to enjoy them in act you don't need to know anthing at all about the games or how it relates to the books. But i you ind them via the games they should add to your appreciation o the characters who pass through. ;United Kingdom;Europe;6

At age 5 the amily rented a small arm house on an active arm 40 miles southwest o St. Louis. While the amily weren't armers they lived something o a homestead type lie raising a milk cow sometimes two and calves a pig or two chickens and the occasional goat. Along with the stock a large garden helped to eed Jerry's three brothers and two sisters or several years. Fishing and hunting contributed to the pantry as did oraging the wild edibles on the property.At the age o 14 the amily minus a brother and two sisters that were now adults and on their own moved back to Senath. Having been encouraged rom an early age to read Jerry was a regular patron o the Senath Branch Library.A love o a good story was born within him and shortly beore graduating high school or a lack o stories that he liked at the library he began to write short vignettes and started taking notes or stories that he wanted to tell. Well a ull lie interceded and the writing didn't resume or several years.But while working a job with a much ree time and the then newangled home computer Jerry began to write in earnest. With the occasional gap in the process Jerry continued to research and write never believing he could ever be published. But when he turned 50 he wanted a change in his lie let the job he was doing and began ocusing on his writing.When he became ill the writing stopped but not the inspiration.

3387;Robert Hutchinson;male;https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1461685845p7/123506.jpg;It took me our years to research write and revise my irst novel The Shadow Catchers and it would be another two years beore the book was published by St. Martin's Press. The dream o being a writer has been with me or a considerably longer time.By the time I was ive years old I'd mapped out exactly what I was going to do with my lie: I would be (in no particular order) a Superhero an Astronaut and a Mad Scientist. Two years later I'd added Actor and Cartoonist to the list. By the end o the ith grade I'd inally decided that I could accomplish all o these by telling stories or a living. The darker the better.I'm not exactly sure when my ascination with the shadow side began. Probably with that collection o Batman comics. When I was eight years old I read George Orwell's Animal Farm thinking it was a happy kiddie story like Charlotte's Web. To this day whenever I see one o those movies about talking pigs who save the arm I remember Napoleon the hog sending Boxer the horse to the butcher's in exchange or a barrel o whiskey. And I go make mysel a nice ham sandwich with pork rinds.I was born in Mobile Alabama on March 10 1964 the youngest o six children. My parents made sure we all got an education. Ater high school I attended the University o the South a liberal arts school owned by the Episcopal Church. Popularly known as Sewanee the college allowed me to pursue all my interests as well as helping to develop new ones. Ater earning my B.A. I studied Theatre in Great Britain and Ireland on a Thomas J. Watson ellowship then received my M.F.A. in Playwriting rom Carnegie-Mellon University.My irst real job was in the marketing department at Universal Pictures where I got to do just about everything rom publicity to speechwriting and creative design. In 1994 I helped start Digital Planet one o the irst Internet design irms to specialize in entertainment marketing. My business partner and I had already created the irst interactive movie press kit (or Sneakers) and were soon designing sites and DVDS or all the major studios as well as corporate clients like Intel and the United States Postal Service. We also produced the Internet's irst ully animated series Madeleine's Mind. In 1998 Digital Planet was acquired by a corporate parent. I stayed on or two years as L.A. creative director then took a brie stint at another company DNA Studio. I let the business not long ater the dotcom bust o 2000. I'm very happy I had my Caliornia adventure...and I'm not sorry it ended. I knew I had to move on i I was going to make my iction career happen.Ater our challenging and invigorating years teaching Literature and Creative Writing at the University o South Alabama I decided to devote mysel to writing ull-time. Currently I'm living on the Alabama Gul Coast working on my ourth novel while preparing or the March 2009 publication o Broken Wing. My latest adventure has returned me to my early love o the theatre: next year I am honored to serve as the Tennessee Williams playwright-in-residence at my alma mater Sewanee.  ;Spain;Europe;7

His irst novel Deadweight interweaves a King-like plot penile implants and splatterpunk extremes o sex and violence managing all the while to be a sensitive spot-on portrayal o an abused woman incapable o relinquishing her role as victim.Walking Wounded his next novel explores the dilemma o a good woman able to heal with her hands but also to harm even unto death whose discovery that her husband is cheating on her moves her against her every humane impulse to activate his Huntington's Disease and take him down.Robert went on to shock the bluenoses with Santa Steps Out in which Santa Claus's gradual recall o his prior existence as Pan leads to an aair with the Tooth Fairy while a voyeuristic Easter Bunny tries to twitch and wiggle his way into Mrs. Claus's good graces.

He was born and raised in the Gooi a upper class region to the southeast o Amsterdam. His youth there served as an inspiration or his ironic attitude toward the rich the successul and all those who are pretending to be either. Ater being kicked out o several high schools he inally completed the one where he also led the school theater and moved to Amsterdam. There he was one o the ounding members o Cabaret NAR (Cabaret Jester). Throughout all the changes in Cabaret NAR Youp was the only constant actor in it and because o him ocusing more and more on their shows he gradually became Cabaret NAR. In the beginning he (or Cabaret NAR) was not very successul oten not even successul enough to pay or their own shows. During all this he worked in some o those boring mind-numbing riskless black-and-white have-to-wear-a-suit 9-to-5 kind o oice jobs which later inspired many o his jokes and imitations.In the early 1980s Cabaret NAR success declined and Youp moved on as a solo artist. From then on he has had great popularity. Though his shows and statements may be considered controversial he has developed himsel not only as a comedian but also as an idealist. His humor is always mixed with a sense o irony towards modern lie culture and national and international politics. Other themes oten ound in his shows and humor are death hypocrisy the innocence o children the sincerity o the elderly the gap between what society expects rom you and what you deep in your heart want the most and the question: ;France;Europe;8

I went on the road with the Sex Pistols Clash Jam and Stranglers amongst others and wrote about my experiences in the book '77 Sulphate Strip. In the '80s I published the magazine Flexipop! that eatured a lexi-disc on the cover o each issue containing a song exclusively recorded or the mag by the likes o Blondie The Jam Madness The Cure Bauhaus Genesis etc. Alas the magazine was eventually banned but has since attained cult status.

A book about the magazine will be published later this year and Spandau Ballet have provided a never beore released lexi-disc to accompany it. ;Spain;Europe;7

6908;Danielle Lenee Davis;female;https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1390629852p7/7785425.jpg;When you're not writing how do you spend your time? Eating chocolate. Okay seriously? I'm usually working at my day job reading or helping my daughter with her homework. People who know me know that I'm not kidding about the chocolate. :-) How do you discover the ebooks you read? I search online or riends tell me i they've read something they enjoyed. Otherwise I wait until a book title comes to me in a dream. Really. Do you remember the irst story you ever wrote? Yes! I wrote it many years ago. It wasn't even a story. It was a scene and I thought it was great. It wasn't. What is your writing process? When I come up with an idea I do some research to lesh it out. I I decide it will make an interesting book I start jotting down plot points. Once I get that I note what I think should happen in each chapter. It's just a couple o sentences. Then I elaborate on that and include a sentence or two about the scenes in the chapter. Okay we're going back to the dream again here. But I'm serious this time. :-) Sometimes when I'm driving to or rom work I sort o daydream. I think most o us do that. From time to time when I daydream thoughts o my book come to me and the characters start talking in my head. When that happens while I'm driving I grab my mini digital recorder and speak into it. I get the same thoughts when I'm in bed trying to all asleep. I usually turn on the light and start writing. And there you have it. Do you remember the irst story you ever read and the impact it had on you? Uh no. No I don't. Now that the question has been asked I'm eeling a bit sad that I don't remember. Okay lie goes on. I'm over it. Next question. How do you approach cover design? For my irst cover I printed out online book covers o the authors I enjoy reading. I looked at the covers o the books I own. I studied the opinions o book designers on what made a good cover. Since I'm sure nobody would take a second look at a book cover I drew I browsed stock images. A LOT o stock images. I wanted an image that created an emotional reaction in me. I think i it does that or me it may also do it or a reader browsing or books. I used a ont that was recommended or the type o book I wrote. For the cover o my second book I had an idea in mind and went back to the stock images. Hopeully that book (Criminal Negligence) will be ready by the end o 2014. I it's not well then it's not. Shoot me. What do you read or pleasure? Mysteries/Suspense. I like my heart to race. Well except i it involves running. I don't want that. In a book I like trying to igure out what's going on beore the author tells me. I I can't igure out who did the dirty deed and the story is compelling I'll read that author again. In act I'll seek out their next book and probably buy all o the series. I preer to read series. What is your e-reading device o choice? Currently it's the Kindle 6;Germany;Europe;2

As a child I made up stories in my head while working in the peanut ields on my ather's arm during the long hot days o summer. My high school English teacher encouraged me to put my imagination on paper. Many years later I submitted Happy Valley and then the sequel Mississippi Gambler. Both have done quite well.  Although Faded Rose was the third novel released it was the irst novel that I had written. I wrote Faded Rose as a orm o therapy during a time in my lie when I was struggling with personal issues. Writing has always been therapy or me just as when I was a child and made up stories in my head. Stories have always been my escape route.

He thought I had a real talent or it and I did what pretty much any teenager does when an adult gives them advice.I ignored him.Twenty years later I was tired o a corporate lie and chose to get back into writing. I joined a local comedy troupe.And I wrote.Writing sketches is a lot o un. Watching the skits you've written come to lie through the actors on stage is amazing. I was hooked instantly but unortunately the troupe wasn't able to continue perorming.I wanted a career in writing so I went back to university and inished my degree. I learned how to write proessionally and I'm happy to have made it my career.And then I ound the Kindle Select Program.Watching you the reader take the time to download my stories rate them and then come back to see i there's anything else is better than any drug in the world ( I asked Charlie Sheen as I don't have direct experience in this arena...)While I'm still pretty early in days o KDP I'm looking orward to the ebook world and the possibilities it brings to the indy author.
