1;2023-06-15 16:23:00;3.0; I must admit this book was no light read  It is a hefty volume  and at times  the sheer magnitude of the events covered where overwhelming  However  Shirer s engaging narrative style kept me hooked till the end  Shirer s storytelling skills are remarkable  transforming the complexities of this dark period into a captivating narrative that reads like a movie screenplay   I m curious to hear if any of you have read this book and what your thoughts are  Did you find it as enthralling as I did  Do you have other recommendations for similarly gripping historical reads ;362

5;2023-06-15 14:59:00;0.0;I tried out this website  MyStoryBooks  where I submit some images of my kid and AI generates images of them in the book  Not sure what everyone s thoughts were because it came out well but how does this affect the industry ;1576
6;2023-06-15 15:14:00;2.0;This doesn t seem written by AI so I m not sure it really impacts the industry at all  People doing this probably aren t going to commission an illustrator to make a book with their kid in it either  so I don t think it matters   The images do seem kind of creepy though ;657
7;2023-06-15 15:56:00;1.0;So I m downsizing my book collection from 750 to what I hope will become 350 only 150 left to go   I think it ll be much easier for me to let go of books knowing that they ll go to a good cause  Any suggestions for organizations to donate books to  I d prefer donating to Africa or India I m in the United States   but anything that ll help people will do   Thank you ;1124

16;2023-06-15 13:11:00;20.0;Legitimate question  How does a library choose which books to carry  I could understand this law in the context of a book that is already in a library being removed for an illegitimate reason  but couldn t a library just choose to not carry a book from the start and not give a reason ;2056
17;2023-06-15 13:50:00;12.0;Please don t ban me for asking  but isn t the biggest kerfuffle about banning certain materials from elementary school classrooms  and libraries  What books are being banned from public libraries ;176

22;2023-06-15 15:08:00;14.0;Democracy does not mean embracing freedom of knowledge it means everybody gets to vote for better and for worse   The ideal that democracy means anything else but equal representation of desires is a false  that being said I am happy with this move and hope other states follow ;1901
23;2023-06-15 15:26:00;2.0;I mean it s a nice thing to say but just like the book bans themselves it s meaningless   Libraries are curated by librarians  Now a state a school district or school can override the librarian and say hey we don t want this book in a specific school but the book isn t banned  it s just been curated  It s still available throughout the state  Note the reason for state or schools not having the book might be stupid and wrong headed but we already do this at the librarian school and school district levels    Similarly  I m certain there are protections in these anti book banking bills  but a librarian school or school district can still say nope we re not including this book  Because libraries are curated ;1708

39;2023-06-15 15:15:00;1.0;This should be federal  Book censorship is one of the few slippery slopes that actually is not a fallacy   If books are dangerous for kids provide educated personel that will know which books is not for kids and put in a restricted area  But outright banning them is insane ;1041
40;2023-06-15 15:21:00;0.0;Freedom of knowledge is the most laughable shit I ve ever heard    Companies have secrets and know things that could save humanity but it s not easy to make profit from it so it s never released    We would upend society to fix this and it s only getting worse  How easy is it to find a book that exists digitally only and is not findable via google   We can do it today but maybe not forever ;2318

44;2023-06-15 15:45:00;1.0;I m worried this will have the opposite effect  I haven t read the text of the law but if you punish the library system for book bans then all an anti book city council or state legislature would need to do is try and ban some books then have someone sue and bankrupt the library forcing it to close ;2437

83;2023-06-15 14:31:00;4.0;It depends on a lot of stuff  and librarians who post on here are usually pretty good about answering but the list basically goes 1  things they know from borrowing history that their patrons could or would use  2  Updated versions of popular books  so if you got a lot of kids who can t afford princeton review but are college bound  they ll get new SAT ACT guides when the new editions come out  3  Things based on trade publications that they think their patrons will like  so popular seeming new books like that Eig MLK bio that just came out seemed like it will be one of the big summer reads  so they d get stuff like that  4  Stuff that has worked well in other similar libraries  5  Things patrons are requesting  If you dig around libraries websites you ll usually find a place to submit acquisition recommendations  This and search queries in their catalogue give them a feel for what their community thinks it s missing    There s other things too  like a librarians personal interests can play a part  But those are the ones that get put up a lot on here ;40

218;2023-06-15 15:08:00;1.0;Yes  I  obviously  care and I m clearly not hiding that fact  That s now what I meant when I said who gives a shit  And it s not about knowing that gay penguins exist  we actually it is in the same sense as knowing that gay people exist is important  it s about the point of the damn story  And the point of the story is that same sex families are just as valid as heterosexual families  and it s obviously important for children to learn that  But I don t actually expect you to listen  and I m not going to explain this a third time so if you re going to keep playing this game go bother somebody else;38

229;2023-06-16 00:41:00;1.0;I think you may have it reverse  Publishers don t go for unique covers because they are not sure it will attract buyers  Lots of books go for the cover style that sells  So as much as we clown  some people like them and keep buying them   I think it s kinda a good thing though  Those covers are usually samey in its contents  so people who enjoy them could stick to them and we could avoid them lol;935

231;2023-06-16 00:42:00;1.0;I think you might be projecting a bit  I was just curious if you understood the sentence and still disliked it  or if you thought it was word salad like you said in your original comment  Did you read Blood Meridian all the way through  That sentence is about the fact that Judge Holden can t be explained through any rational means  It means that to the main character  and to us as the reader who are wondering if the judge is really a supernatural force  or actually just some guy  It also has the added meaning of commenting on the fact that although Blood Meridian and Judge Holden himself are based on actual events and people  the characters and plot transcend the original works on which they are based  and it would be pointless to judge his character according to those   Also  a poll was done on authors and editors asking their favorite novels of the 20th century and blood meridian came in second  Maybe if that crowd thinks its the height if literary achievement  it might actually be so ;1544

239;2023-06-15 23:36:00;0.0;I ve found a variety of nonfiction  self help  memoirs  biographies  and fictional books motivating or inspiring  They are helpful for different things and at different times   The book that I ve found most motivating these days is an old self help book by Eckhart Tolle s  called The Power of Now  Like many self help books  it is far from perfect  For example  it can get repetitive  And it oversimplifies certain things  But all in all  I feel my time has not been wasted reading it   Here are three quotes from the book  just to give you an idea of what it s like   1  When you act out of present moment awareness  whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality  care  and love   even the most simple action  2  Past and future obviously have no reality of their own  Just as the moon has no light of its own  but can only reflect the light of the sun  so are past and future only pale reflections of the light  power  and reality of the eternal present  Their reality is  borrowed  from the Now  3  Any lesson from the past becomes relevant and is applied now  Any planning as well as working toward achieving a particular goal is done now   The reason I find this book motivating is that it helps ground me in the present  where my true power lies  A lot of my time is wasted worrying about future or regretting past actions  to the point that sometimes I don t feel fully present or aware of what is going on around me or where I am  So  I feel a lack of motivation only because I m reacting to things that happened  before  or  could  happen in the future   Therefore  the book s message  though deceptively simple  is a useful reminder for me to stop and come back to the here and now  where I  can  make a difference   What have you found helpful when you feel depressed or lack motivation  and why ;2269
240;2023-06-16 00:15:00;0.0;  I am about to start chapter sixteen of  The Shining   Something I really must say is that I am still genuinely finding Jack Torrance hard to sympathize with  In the first chapter I read today  Jack reflects on the incident wherein he physically harmed a student of his  this is what led to him losing his job  and having to work at the Overlook Hotel   I was just  disgusted whilst reading it  Jack is a complex character  and this is what I really like about King  that his characters are not one dimensional or flawless  most  of the time and typically have interesting backgrounds  but his behavior as a teacher was just so disturbing to a point wherein I found myself reading and thinking  God  I know the point is that this man wants to improve himself  but he really is a bad person   The way that the student   George   is described  the way their interactions went  it was just gross to me  As an adult  he REALLY should have been able to keep his temper whilst working with this student  George   For some reason  the fact that Jack notices that George is handsome  looks like Robert Redford specifically  also bothers me somewhat because it s just  I don t know  it just makes me uncomfortable  it seems  inappropriate  I don t know  I didn t think it was normal for high school teachers to notice that one of their students is attractive  I hope that that s not normal   I am definitely still impressed by King s writing and do feel that him giving us more insight early on into what the characters  thoughts are  what Jack and Wendy s parents were like  etc  is helpful and I enjoy reading about their youth past experiences  it helps the reader get a better idea of who they are  of what has made them into the people they are now   I just find Jack to be rather unsympathetic  and abusive  God  I really wonder what other people who have read this book think of it  A page turner  but disturbing  and I haven t even gotten to the frightening parts yet  ;235
241;2023-06-15 23:51:00;31.0;Jack is an alcoholic who is destroying his own life and those around him   I m not sure we are supposed to sympathize with him ;69
242;2023-06-16 00:06:00;18.0;I liked The Shining  I didn t like Jack and I didn t get the impression we were supposed to ;1630
243;2023-06-16 00:20:00;16.0;I never got the impression we were supposed to like Jack at all  He is definitely complex and compelling to read about  but in a tragic way  We re rooting for the family to survive their troubles not for his sake but for Wendy s and Danny s  Just because he s the  main character  it doesn t mean we have to like sympathize with him    There s a slight misconception in the argument between the film and the book  A lot of people criticize Jack in the film because he was  crazy from the start  in how he was portrayed by the actor  That leads into this idea that  Jack was a normal man before he fell under the influence of the Overlook   and it s  kinda  true  but it s not to say he was a happy  successful man with a loving and adoring family  Their problems existed well before  and Jack s worst qualities had already manifested in the past  What the Overlook does is prey on them and exacerbate them  using him for its own advantages  It s tragic    King does this a lot  especially whenever he returns to the town of Derry  The underlying idea there is that Pennywise knows how to prey upon and use the worst qualities of people  bringing them out to incite as much hate and violence as possible ;1949
244;2023-06-16 00:25:00;12.0;You are supposed to be disgusted by Jack  He is disgusting  He is a violent  abusive drunk  a sexist  and a creep    By showing you the characters  pasts  King is showing you how they evolved to be what they are now  but that is not necessarily to build empathy  It s just explanation  Plenty of people had violent or otherwise traumatic childhoods  but they don t abuse the people around them  It is a choice  Jack chooses to be the way he is  He could get help  or remove himself from situations that cause him to behave badly  but he doesn t  He chooses to continue to be a destructive force  And  we should despise him for that   Edit  extra word;757
245;2023-06-15 23:19:00;6.0;Why would you think you re supposed to ;2341
246;2023-06-15 23:35:00;1.0;Jack is a very messed up  bad dude  He s complex and upsetting and it s really uncomfortable to be in his head  That s a normal thing for a book to do  You re not supposed to  like  the main character of whatever you re reading just because they re the main character  Sometimes you re following a bad person ;1231
247;2023-06-15 23:36:00;4.0;I never thought we were supposed to LIKE Jack  I do think we were supposed to empathize with him somewhat  It s been a while since I read it  but from memory  I recall some of his POV scenes show that he was remorseful  and wanted to be a better person than he was  His demons  his alcoholism  and his temper were just bigger than he could deal with alone  Then the hotel got its hooks into him   ;1947
248;2023-06-16 00:28:00;1.0;You aren t meant to sympathize with Jack lol  Just because he is the main character does not mean he is supposed to be sympathetic ;775
249;2023-06-15 22:20:00;3.0;You know Jack is the antagonist right;1122
250;2023-06-15 05:50:00;3.0;I didn t sympathise with Jack at all in this book  I felt sorry for his family   The true horror of The Shining is showing how Jack as an alcoholic is destroying his own life and trying to destroy his family too   He is on a pathway to self destruct and nothing can stop him ;2097
251;2023-06-15 03:35:00;1.0;You re not supposed to sympathize with him lol;2420

255;2023-06-15 12:57:00;1.0;I never felt like Jack was supposed to be sympathetic  He is generally not a good person with a lot of faults  especially where his family is concerned  You might enjoy it more if you lean in to hating him ;1067

257;2023-06-15 04:48:00;2.0;I ve lived over half of my life in America  and I can assure you that to this culture Slave is no less demeaning than the N word  Fun fact  both are used to arouse people who have a fetish for being humiliated disrespected   I didn t mean to imply that you re a liar  and I m sorry if I made you feel that I intended to   As to your last points  most authors are alive for the first several edits of their works  and do give consent for the edits  most even employ an editor to read their manuscripts and make edits before sending the work to a publisher  It s not a stretch to infer that they d like their work to continue being edited to be enjoyed by the largest number of readers   Terry Pratchett provides a great counter example  With the exception of  Good omens   which was such a collaboration with Neil Gaiman that both men said they don t even know which ideas were theirs  he didn t want people changing his works after he died and requested that his unfinished works be destroyed by steam roller   I guess I could simplify my stance  and if it creates a problem for you  we ll just know that we ll eternally disagree  If Mark Twain we re alive today  I believe that he would agree with re writing portions of Huck Finn  If he wouldn t  and felt that those abuses were vital to the tone he wanted to convey I d be happy not reading any of his work   Our dated words get replaced all the time  English used to have a dative form of you  thou  and before that  ou  the first one is only ever seen in biblical texts  and the second would probably be mistaken for a Scandinavian word  I wouldn t be upset over a line like  er wichst die Schuhe des Manns  being replaced with something that better reflects Modern Deutsch ;252
258;2023-06-15 03:32:00;53.0;I ve seen The Secret History by Donna Tartt frequently recommended  here and other places    I did enjoy the book   It was well written and kept me engaged   But the whole time  I felt like I was missing something   Like there was something deeper or something more meaningful going on that I was too dumb to understand   I saw the ending from a mile away   I was kind of expecting some sort of twist  or something more   But it just kind of ended like nothing out of the ordinary   Am I missing something here   Was there something really brilliant that my non literary mind wasn t able to pick up ;263
259;2023-06-15 11:53:00;30.0;I liked it  I thought the ending was a bit rushed and share your sentiment about the final chapter or so feeling a bit predictable  I also tend to really enjoy the trope in books where the narrator is not actually the  main character     To my mind  Richard wasn t the main character and was a passive character in much of the events even right up to the end of the novel  This is a personal preference  but when this is done well and in engaging ways  I always find it fascinating and even more emersing as a reader  as the reader  we are forced to watch and participate in the events of the novel in the same way Richard is  ;2415
260;2023-06-15 12:43:00;14.0;I had the same problem  I think I was looking for extra subtext and meaning in everything and just confused myself   I liked it but didn t feel like I really understood it  I might have to reread it at a less busy time ;2323
261;2023-06-15 13:24:00;28.0;Finished this book last week  Loved it     I liked how Richard was an unreliable narrator  often on the periphery of the original group  His bias in representing the other characters  especially the twins  made sense in the narrative  and had me questioning so much of the story in the latter half    I liked how much of the book was left unanswered  regarding the initial murder  as well as Tartt s use of subtle supernatural elements throughout  especially with regards to the Bacchanal  The implication that the  Dionysus   figure  leading the group might have been Julian  or that Julian had more involvement than we were initially lead to believe  talking privately in Latin    with Henry in the garden   Or perhaps the true Dionysus figure was Henry  leader of the group  who spoke Ancient Greek more fluently than English  and went off with a noble Greek death in the end  Henry may very well have just been a genius level sociopath who felt justified in his actions by Julian s teachings  but had a crisis when Julian abandoned him    In the latter chapters  when driving on the road  the boys almost hit a wild cat  catamount   They argue about whether or not wild cats are actually in the area   This is the same area where the farmer was killed   It reveals just how little the group actually knows  and introduces a bit of doubt  How did Charles have a non human bite mark  Did the group chase a deer and disembowel it  attracting a cougar  Did the cougar attack the farmer    For how brilliant Henry was  remember that he didn t even know men had walked on the moon  The group is intelligent  but their focus is very limited ;1401
262;2023-06-15 14:03:00;36.0;I guess it depends on what you like in a book  No book is objectively amazing for every person that reads it  I just read To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf and it was not for me  It s literary genius  I know  but I personally just didn t have a fun time   What I loved about the Secret History was the story of obsession  the extremely vibey setting atmosphere  and how much fun I had following such unlikeable  horrible characters  The critique of academia is one of the  points  but it s not necessarily what made me love it  The novel is for sure a character study rather than one that excels in plot  so if you re a more plot focused reader  and you might be based on your comments about the lack of a twist and seeing the ending coming  you re probably not going to find it as immersive as someone who loves a character focused book ;767
263;2023-06-15 21:12:00;6.0;i had much the same reaction to if we were villains  which everyone seems to compare to the secret history ;989
264;2023-06-15 07:42:00;6.0;I was also underwhelmed  I thought the writing  characters  plot development were average   not bad  just not a page turner and not a book I think of as memorable ;1664
265;2023-06-15 08:23:00;21.0;  Was there something really brilliant that my non literary mind wasn t able to pick up   Kinda  I wouldn t put it like that  but it does sound like the things that make the book great didn t really resonate with you   The big strengths of the book are its characters and prose and atmosphere  It s got a lot going on beyond that too  but the fundamental beauty of the work  the thing I think you missed  is in experiencing the characters and their interactions  feeling the closeness and the strangeness between them  watching these weird fucking dorks spiral in on themselves in their own unique ways  It s not so much about  what happens next  as it is about watching how the characters respond to what s happening now   A lot of literary fiction succeeds more on the back of the profound exploration of character and theme and the expressive power of prose than it does on conventional character arcs and satisfying conflict resolution  It s a different type of storytelling than you see in a lot of more mainstream works  so it can be a bit of an acquired taste ;697
266;2023-06-15 11:44:00;7.0;I listened to the audiobook version  It was narrated by the author  which was a shame  The voice she did for Bunny  I can t even  Anyhow  yeah  I thought I would love it and was really underwhelmed  I blame the narration  but maybe it just wasn t the book for me ;546
267;2023-06-15 11:12:00;11.0;I had the same reaction  I really doubted my mind seeing how everyone raves about it and while it is def good  I felt I didn t exactly grasp everything    Esp cos her other book The Goldfinch completely immersed me in a way books haven t in many years  I was on another level emotionally while reading latter  so all the more I wondered what I couldn t see in TSH   hailed as a landmark sort of book that birthed  dark academia    I might read it again just to find out ;194
268;2023-06-15 11:53:00;5.0;It s good you saw the ending coming a mile away because the author tells you and reminds you throughout the book  Haha;1562
269;2023-06-15 14:28:00;3.0;The secret history is sometimes over applauded for its depth and under applauded for it s character and plot complexity    I adore this book because the characters are absolutely masterful  Tartt is one of a long tradition of writers who create authentic  unique characters  and then places then situations where they become the most interesting versions of themselves   Bunny  for example  is a character who has been told his whole life that money is the most important thing in the world  but it is a crime to work for it  For her to create that character  then put him in a situation where he has 5 rich kids at his mercy is really genius   Another thing that s genius about the secret history is her use of an unreliable narrator  Like Fitzgerald s Nick Caraway  the more you re read the Secret History  the more you realise he lies about everything   A good example is how he portrays bunny  as this person who didn t really know what was coming   but the letter bunny sends to Julian tells you that he knew very well he was about to die and there was nothing he could do to stop it   Richard is the absolute worst of the Greek class   and the more you read the story the more you realise just how awful he is and how the entire story is him trying to justify his actions   TL DR   while not philosophically as deep as some people may think  the Secret History is fathoms deep in terms of character and plot complexity  You can read it a hundred times and find something new always   this is something great novels do ;1942
270;2023-06-15 07:37:00;2.0;I agree  To me the problem with this book is there is too much telling vs showing  All the juicy bits are narrated to the MC by other characters rather than immersing us in them directly  It takes away from the experience ;2003
271;2023-06-15 05:59:00;2.0;Now I want to reread it;1650
272;2023-06-15 07:56:00;2.0;It also is way too long for its content  The pacing was way off because of the length  most of which was day to day filler  It s supposed to be a suspense thriller  but its 600 pages really slows the excitement  Honestly would be better around 250 300 pages  And yes  the interesting hook for the whole story is the bacchanalia and the taboo sexual content  but she only ever briefly touches that stuff and never gets into that darker element that s just below the surface  Would be much more intriguing for the reader than walking around campus and sleeping in an old warehouse  How did they pull it off  Why did they do it once but never again  Henry in particular  Why isn t the protagonist initiated into the cult  Why didn t the reader get to experience the bacchanalia  The twins are incestuous  but WHY ;1349
273;2023-06-15 16:08:00;5.0;I don t think you missed anything   it s not really a  twist  book   it s just a study in how actions have consequences  some of them on a very slow fuse ;840
274;2023-06-15 16:55:00;2.0;Firstly  the prose is beautiful      But also  our narrator is naiive as fuck  they all are  he tells us a story of archetypical greek characters  but it breaks down as people do not so readily fit into prim little boxes defined by millenia old myths ;1288
275;2023-06-15 07:57:00;1.0;It s a fairly vapid and shallow reading IMO  Feels like reading someone who pretends to be smart as an aesthetic value rather than actually engaging with any real philosophical or social entanglements  It kind of purports itself as saying something about  le hard questions  but it really says a whole lot of nothing  I guess it s kind of nice to live vicariously through Dark Academia though;2362
276;2023-06-15 08:18:00;1.0;It s the journey  not the destination ;2224
277;2023-06-15 11:44:00;0.0;Why this book is not a movie yet or Netflix series is beyond me  It is so visual and atmospheric but maybe it would stall with the pace ;1681
278;2023-06-15 06:49:00;1.0;You re not missing anything  Donna Tartt is f ing boring ;333
279;2023-06-15 11:52:00;-1.0;i ve just seen the title and I ordered the book    ;2192

281;2023-06-15 05:54:00;1.0;Probably the thing that got me was the  abbreviation  audiobook read by Robert Sean Leonard      I hadn t realised the invasive effect and the power of the character Henry  and how he actually was the biggest manipulator in the story until that audiobook  Or how Richard was really betraying everyone in favour of Henry s good graces    ;1910
282;2023-06-15 08:58:00;1.0;Not every book is for everyone  Even really good ones ;2234
283;2023-06-15 20:54:00;1.0;Well mostly what I love about it is how beautiful the language is and evocative it is of a specific place and time  I tend to love stories set on college campuses  including newer novels like Tana French s  The Likeness   ML Rio s  We Were Villains   and RF Kuang s  Babel    As much as I enjoyed those books though  you can tell this one is a step above because of how well written it is  Tartt is a master at deploying descriptive language in a way that doesn t ever get tedious  I also loved that the reasons for the murder are ultimately so mundane and banal  And that they get away with it  So it ends up teaching Richard that there is no such thing as  karmic justice  in life  which is true   Idk  I just thought it really rang true to real life for me  I love everything about it  It s definitely one of my all time faves ;1324

286;2023-06-15 13:00:00;6.0;I m trying to figure out what the  twist  is  honestly;633
287;2023-06-15 12:55:00;4.0;Same  I feel like for both these books if you don t find something specific to really latch onto  a character  a trope  they won t stand out to you  because taken from an overall perspective they re not particularly special;1602
288;2023-06-15 06:34:00;1.0;Thank you for describing my thoughts perfectly ;2060
289;2023-06-15 22:36:00;3.0;I had the opposite reaction  I absolutely loved her narration  I think her Bunny in particular was pitch perfect  which is to say  obnoxious and grating  but intentionally so  ;1920
290;2023-06-15 12:34:00;6.0;This is so funny  I loved her narration  Bunny s voice especially added so much character  though I can see how it may get annoying ;1074
291;2023-06-15 16:08:00;4.0;What  Her narration is iconic;2413
292;2023-06-15 01:51:00;2.0;I read TSH first and it immediately became one of my all time favorites  So I decided to read The Goldfinch and had the same reaction you did to TSH  The Goldfinch just didn t even come close to giving me the depth of feeling I got from TSH ;527
293;2023-06-15 01:29:00;3.0;I agree about The Goldfinch  Something about that book completely pulled me in like I was there  Out of hundreds and hundreds of books I read  it was one of like three that had this effect on me     Now  I did like The Secret History  It was a good slow burn with a ton of character development  Although the premise seems like it should have had a lot of suspense  it really doesn t  It s more about the examination of guilt and dishonesty    On the other hand  I can t get into The Little Friend  It just doesn t resonate with me much ;1635
294;2023-06-15 21:40:00;1.0;And yes  my comment is also way too long ;1027
295;2023-06-12 03:15:00;1.0;This is how I felt reading it  I think I would have enjoyed this a lot more when I was a teenager or even in my early 20 s before I had much life experience  The fact that the characters act the way they do and talk the way they do but they are only college aged was hilarious to me  I get that s part of the point but I just couldn t get into it  I can definitely see it though when you re at that age and you feel so smart and deep ;2283
296;2023-06-12 00:43:00;1.0;Mark;24
297;2023-06-12 00:50:00;5.0;I loved her narration too  and Bunny is meant to be annoying  She wrote him  she knows what he s supposed to sound like  Tartt also does a great reading of True Grit ;2214
298;2023-06-12 03:52:00;1.0;This is 99  of Donna Tartt readers  They love one book but cannot connect with the other ;2409
299;2023-06-12 01:45:00;2.0; Although the premise seems like it should have had a lot of suspense  it really doesn t  It s more about the examination of guilt and dishonesty    This explains it so well  I went into it thinking it will be a good crime thriller or drama and the impact of a crime on a group of friends  But like you said it was more of an examination and study  an excellent one yes  But I had no emotional connection to the book  and maybe that s anyways not why the author wrote the book  It isn t that kind of literature ;1220
300;2023-06-12 00:36:00;3.0; The fact that the characters act the way they do and talk the way they do but they are only college aged was hilarious to me  I get that s part of the point but I just couldn t get into it   Honestly  I think you can enjoy the book on multiple levels     Donna Tartt was satirizing her own college experience     The Greek students were all based on real people that actually did dress and act this way    and why  Because Brideshead Revisited  the 1981 miniseries  was really popular  So you had this group of kids pretending to be at Oxford and acting incredibly pretentiously in the process  The book is romanticizing elite hire education    and also criticizing satirizing it at the same time  Donna Tartt is making fun of students at her school    while also wanting to be them    Those layers of romanticization and judgement    the tension between being an  insider  and an  outsider     the creation of a certain persona    That s what I love the most about this book  It reminds me of The Great Gatsby  how Fitzgerald was both romanticizing and criticizing the very wealthy  He always wanted to be a part of the wealthy elite    but he also held judgements against the elite  I think it s the same way with Donna Tartt    this push pull romanticization and criticism     I also love anything that involves creating personas    creating a fantasy and trying to live the fantasy as reality  That s another connection to The Great Gatsby    And another added layer is how people are now reading The Secret History and copying the aesthetic and calling it  dark academia   So kids now are pretending to be kids in the late 80s who were pretending to be characters from Brideshead Revisited  There s so many layers of romanticization and fantasy and personas  and I find it so fascinating  None of it is new    The name  dark academia  is new  but nothing about the concept is    and I just find it fascinating ;1735
301;2023-06-12 01:43:00;1.0;Agree  some self help books can be long winded    If the book is too long  I will google a summary or keypoints of a particular book  Or I search youtube videos that discussing that book  some creators will even do some graphics for easier understanding  Usually I will get the general ideas of the content  I enjoy reading self help books with short chapter and big fonts eg  Don t sweat the small stuff or The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down  How to Be Calm in a Busy World ;1928
302;2023-06-12 00:27:00;0.0;for better or worse  he s pretty well known for his style   a stronger writer  maybe  as successful  I doubt it ;162
303;2023-06-12 00:23:00;1.0;Finished  Salem s Lot  by Stephen King   A fun  easy read  I have spent my life assuming I would dislike King but I recently read 11 22 63 and loved it  especially the pacing and character setting development  So I thought I d read his major works in order  I was worried Salem s Lot would be too scary  but I didn t find it scary at all  I liked the focus on the town and its people  as well as the allusions to Stoker s Dracula  which is one of my favorites   Started  The Shining  by Stephen King  DNF just over halfway through  Several problems  1  I couldn t see the characters as other than the actors from the movie  I don t like Nicholson or Duvall so that ruined things  2  I couldn t deal with Jack s internal monologue about harming his family  It was too dark for me  probably because it involved a 5 year old and because there was just too much time spent inside Jack s deteriorating mind  I wanted to stick with it to follow Halloran  but I just couldn t do it  It was making me feel horrible  so I put it away permanently   Started  The Druid  by Jeff Wheeler   I loved his Muirwood and Kingfountain series and am excited for this one  It s been a great cozy read so far and will be an effective reset after The Shining disturbed me so much   Started  The House in the Cerulean Sea  by TJ Klune;1019
304;2023-06-12 01:20:00;563.0;English is my first language btw  and I can read     Is this book considered difficult to read  I am finding it very dense and feeling lost as I go   Even on the first page    SEE THE CHILD  He is pale and thin  he wears a thin and ragged linen shirt  He stokes the scullery fire  Outside lie dark turned fields with rags of  snow and darker woods beyond that harbor yet a few last wolves  His folk are known for hewers of wood and drawers of water but in truth his father has been a schoolmaster  He lies in drink  he  quotes from poets whose names are now lost  The boy crouches by the fire and watches him    Night of your birth  Thirty three  The Leonids they were called  God how the stars did fall  I looked for blackness  holes in the heavens  The Dipper stove    I m getting turned around in the second paragraph  Who s perspective is that  Is it dialogue from the father     I ve heard great things about this book  but I m wondering why it s sort of  not clicking  in my mind as I read  Is there a better book of his to start with  Is there any info I should know going into it to help me along the way  Thank you   edit  I appreciate the insight everyone has shared  I m going to keep trudging through it  edit  I m onto chapter 2 now and already getting used to it  Knowing the dialogue has no quotations is helpful  and googling some words I don t know   The book is already amazing and gritty ;395
305;2023-06-12 00:50:00;84.0;In this book  you sometimes have to infer who is speaking based upon the vocabulary and contextual clues  This particular paragraph is written in the voice of the  schoolmaster  who is teaching the boy about the night of his birth  It refers to the 1833 Leonids meteor shower  which was a massive and significant event that made the night sky appear as though it was staving in ;1359
306;2023-06-12 00:25:00;336.0;It is his most difficult book   There s no harm in missing a lot the first time   If you wanted to try a different one to get used to his writing you could go with The Road or No Country for Old Men  those are much more straightforward and will prepare you a bit for Blood Meridian    Personally I would just continue on knowing that I ll read it again   My second read was much more clear than my first ;876
307;2023-06-12 02:00:00;261.0;I have tried reading it three times and have never finished  When I can actually understand the prose I think it is amazing  the rest of the time I feel like I am having a stroke;1374
308;2023-06-12 02:26:00;19.0;I think the biggest issue that took time for me to get used to was the way he writes dialogue and the absolute lack of quotation marks indicating who s talking at times  You get used to it though  I m currently reading through it now ;844
309;2023-06-12 01:39:00;145.0;Do not resist becoming lost  It s part of it    He s a lot like Faulkner  It feels like this big disparate incomprehensible mystery  If you get through to the end you ll have a greater understanding even if you don t know that you do ;1839
310;2023-06-12 02:53:00;55.0;It s not the easiest read but it s well worth it ;717
311;2023-06-12 03:52:00;5.0;This book is really good for reading aloud ;2148
312;2023-06-12 01:52:00;50.0;A big part of the genius of this book is McArthy s use of short  declarative sentences  He s spoken about the intentionality here to not muck up the story with what he calls  useless marks  like punctuation  My advice is to power through until you get his style  It s one of the greatest works in American literature and well worth the time spent ;2004
313;2023-06-12 03:40:00;127.0;Starting with Night of your birth is the father  yes  Just keep going  Reading is a skill and you re encountering something a bit above your level  The only way out is through  If you give up  like this sub loves to encourage people to do  then you will stay at the level you re at  Just keep going   Anyway you don t have to understand everything the first time through  and you won t anyway  no one does with this book   It s just like listening to music or watching a movie  You don t just stop listening to a song if you encounter lyrics you don t understand  right  Do you turn off a movie the second you didn t get something  No  you keep watching   So keep reading  Your reading will improve and eventually you will get the hang of the writing style ;752
314;2023-06-12 03:49:00;21.0;I also found the book to be incredibly difficult to parse ;879
315;2023-06-12 01:44:00;17.0;McCarthy s writing style is more expressive than correct   It takes some getting used to but try to get into getting the feel of the words rather than going by sentences   If that makes any sense     Reading Irvine welsh is a bit of a learning curve as well because he  writes  with a thick Scottish accent   Either writer  take a little time letting yourself get used to it;1366
316;2023-06-12 02:37:00;27.0;It s stream of consciousness   One of the hardest styles of writing both to master and to follow as a reader   I had a class that spent a whole semester just on Ulysses  and let me tell you  it also had me questioning my intelligence ;17
317;2023-06-12 03:04:00;3.0;Yeah it s difficult to understand because the way he writes is so different from other authors but it brings a certain cadence to it that makes it really enjoyable  You ll get used to it eventually but don t fret if you don t understand everything ;1577
318;2023-06-12 03:45:00;3.0;Yeah  I get it  Something that helped me was to not overthink it  And for me  parts of the book could be taken in different ways  I chose my meaning and I m good with it ;1409
319;2023-06-12 01:02:00;10.0;Try listening to the audiobook  It took me a long time to read Blood Meridian  I also felt the need to look up most of the Spanish I didn t understand  so I went with the audiobook of All the Pretty Horses  The narrator did all the hard work for me in knowing where to pause and keeping with a good cadence and pace despite the lack of punctuation  It sounds like a more normal book when someone is reading it aloud ;1223
320;2023-06-12 02:50:00;7.0; Is it considered hard to read     Yes  There are plenty of other books that are more challenging  but Blood Meridian isn t an easy read  Just take it slow  and reread sections if you don t understand it  I m not particularly well read  and I made it through  You will be fine    Also  it s the only book I ve read that made me want to start a reread immediately after finishing it  I read it back to back  Obviously I got a lot more out of it the second time around ;1536
321;2023-06-12 01:48:00;7.0;My theory is that McCarthy writes in this difficult style to force the reader to read every word  rather than scanning the pages   No Country for Old Men and The Road are a little more accessible   So is All the Pretty Horses  but not so much the other two of the border trilogy   Suttree was a struggle for me to get through  but I find that his books left remnants that I think about long after finishing reading them ;2028
322;2023-06-12 00:58:00;8.0;I don t know  or care  what this sub s stance is on audio books  but if reading Blood Meridian gets to be too much  the audio book version is phenomenal and might be the better way for you to experience the story ;2073
323;2023-06-12 00:45:00;7.0;McCarthy s style and idiosyncrasies aren t everyone s cup of tea but if you are able to stick with it  Blood Meridian is an incredible read  It s the only book I ve ever read whereupon finishing the last sentence  I immediately turned back to the first page and started reading it all over again  having become fully acclimated to the prose  Keep in mind  McCarthy tends to write in a cinematic POV  Blood Meridian never really lets you inside anybody s head  I think it s best to just read and let the images wash over you as they come  The story and the characters will take shape and solidify as you go ;1282
324;2023-06-12 00:25:00;2.0;I had to look up a shitload of words while reading  Blood Meridian    It s a tough book   Very rewarding if you see it through  but I didn t finish it until my third try   Once you get deeper into the book  I think it s easier to finish  but it s very difficult and slow early on   I d recommend giving  All the Pretty Horses  a shot   It s got a similar vibe but is a much easier read ;9
325;2023-06-12 01:41:00;7.0;Greatest book of all time;115
326;2023-06-12 01:38:00;9.0;This book was a chore  And I m not totally sure it was worth the effort  I finished it feeling like I was a worse person than I was before I started it ;1361
327;2023-06-12 02:31:00;1.0;Wasn t my favorite of his novels;1730
328;2023-06-12 03:40:00;5.0;It s been said here  but longer into the book than you d like  it will just click and you ll be off  It s an adjustment but not beyond your reach ;2046
329;2023-06-12 02:16:00;2.0;It s fairly simple once you get the hang of it ;828
330;2023-06-12 02:23:00;5.0;I will never understand the love for this book  Probably because I literally can t understand it ;437
331;2023-06-12 01:12:00;3.0;It was a DNF for me  On the one hand  I admire his ability to express certain things so succinctly  On the other hand  the whole book is that way  Just couldn t get into it  Too much effort for too little return for me  Too many other books to read ;921
332;2023-06-14 13:22:00;1.0;It might make you question how much pretentiousness you can handle but that s about it ;943
333;2023-06-15 16:03:00;4.0;I really appreciate everyone else s thoughts on this book  Think I m going to continue on reading it since most of seem to recommend it  I knew nothing of this author until this post  Thanks for educating me ;83
334;2023-06-16 00:51:00;0.0;Don t worry  you re not an idiot    I found a PDF of this book  and started reading  I think that this beginning part is awkward and lacking in punctuation  I feel that it s the father speaking to the child in the second paragraph  I ve skimmed a few more paragraphs  and it does get better  although from what little I ve read the author has very unique way of writing and he doesn t have the right orthographic marks ;796
335;2023-06-12 02:52:00;1.0;Same here   Had to restart 3 times for the book to finally click for me    Used to hate it  thought it was pretentious   Still might be  but I m glad for it   Love this book ;2143
336;2023-06-14 12:44:00;1.0;I recently read The Road  and i couldn t agree more   McCarthy is a great writer and can build a tone in his characters that is hard to describe   But it is very dense   I found myself rereading certain passages over again to make sure i understood what i read   Once you get into a groove of his writing  you do get lost in it    I d say try to stick with the book if you want  but there is no shame in leaving a book if you find it difficult to the point that you are not gaining anything from it ;2009
337;2023-06-12 03:03:00;1.0;So I remember trying to read the sound and the fury  and 100 pages in I looked up the synopsis on Wikipedia and wasn t getting ANY of it  Felt pretty dumb lol ;1725
338;2023-06-14 08:41:00;1.0;there s a lot of writing in BLOOD MERIDIAN that needs a bit of knowledge to understand  you can study history and other stuff or just be a curious person for a long time  or you can look for annotations  I would not have expected to follow much of it when I was younger ;1722
339;2023-06-14 17:29:00;-21.0;It s Cormac McCarthy  Just give up and find a better book  His writing style is garbage  He ignores grammar rules and just does whatever he wants  some people call it style  but it s just lazy and sloppy writing  in my opinion  Everyone raved about The Road too and I ve never read a worse book    If you aren t enjoying it now  you probably won t  I find he s a very  very acquired taste   one I absolutely can t acquire    To everyone else  come at me  I ll die on this hill  His popularity is astoundingly baffling to me  He should be writing screenplays and not books  His books are atrocious    That being said  you re 100  entitled to disagree and enjoy his work   I m not a gatekeeper  Love what you love  and hate what you hate  But you likely won t convince me to change my opinion on him ;2315
340;2023-06-15 21:30:00;-18.0;That passage is so badly written I would have abandoned it on sight  I allow for literary and poetic stylings and flourishes but when the writer makes it their mission to sound as unnatural as possible  I ll pass   edit to respond to below since posting is restricted   I guess using ridiculous and unnecessary vernacular is impressive to some  I d rather read something that has a natural sound to it  The passage within OP is the opposite of that  so yeah  I ll call it  badly written  ;521
341;2023-06-12 03:17:00;-3.0;There are a ton of made up words so don t feel bad  Just keep going  I m actually rereading it right now ;366
342;2023-06-12 03:03:00;1.0;just started reading it  very excited    ;2114
343;2023-06-12 02:45:00;1.0;I began the Cormac McCarthy journey by listening to some McCarthy podcasts  The visiting scholars featured various books and themes and discussed with such clarity  I am ready to begin reading having a slight idea of what s to come ;1238
344;2023-06-12 03:42:00;1.0;Yeah sounds like you can t read lol;933
345;2023-06-12 04:01:00;-13.0;Not a good choice for your first English language book  Maybe start with Hemingway s The Old Man in the Sea ;1211
346;2023-06-12 03:43:00;-2.0;It s one of those books where people say stupid things like  oh you just have to read the first 43 chapters and then you ll get it   Nope  it s not approachable and people stick it through solely because other people talk about how amazing it is     The prose is to egotistical IMO  is a story REALLY great if 99  of the people who try and read it either never finish or don t understand it because it s designed for you not to    By far his most acclaimed work  and by far the one i enjoyed the least  A few of his will be on my shelf for decades and be continually re read and loved  BM isn t one of them ;717

351;2023-06-12 03:51:00;152.0;Listen to the audiobook narrated by Richard Poe  It s one of those rare audiobooks that feels as if the narrator actually transforms the material ;1234
352;2023-06-12 00:54:00;44.0;I got about 60 pages in three different times  Probably over the course of 5 years or so  On the 4th attempt  I started from page 60 instead of the beginning  and I finally got hooked in  I read chapter recaps online  It really helped me understand what was happening  but it finally all clicked and I didn t need them    Crazy ass book man ;2139
353;2023-06-12 03:40:00;23.0;I ve tried thrice myself with no success  Been listening to The Crossing audiobook and I m struck by how  normal  the prose are  I just end up rereading paragraphs in Blood Meridian over and over again  in equal parts awe and confusion ;501

355;2023-06-12 02:58:00;45.0;I remember picking up The Sound   The Fury knowing literally nothing about it or Faulkner  I just got it cheap and knew it was a  classic   I was so lost and confused for pretty much the entire book but  since I finished it  a small part of it seems to be rattling around in my brain non stop  I haven t read anything like it and I ve got 2 more books of his that I m excited to struggle through  I didn t realise Cormac McCarthy wrote in a  similar  way ;1865
356;2023-06-12 01:56:00;39.0;Yes  I ve found what helps is instead of trying to make sense of it on a sentence by sentence structure  Just vibe through it and if you understand one vague thing that happens per page you re doing okay lol   Just let it wash over you;259
357;2023-06-12 02:09:00;9.0;My question is are the lack of those useless marks ever confusing  or is he pretty straightforward when it is dialogue vs  internal thought vs  description ;1077
358;2023-06-12 00:41:00;32.0;That s super helpful advice  thank you  So throughout the book I need to infer from the perspective context when dialogue is happening and who is speaking   Usually for a movie  if I get lost I pause to think about it or rewind a bit to better understand  if I m watching alone   Maybe I ll need to just go slowly and take that approach with this book ;748
359;2023-06-12 02:55:00;2.0;Thank you ;1109

361;2023-06-14 13:35:00;10.0;Props to the Irvine Welsh nod   Trainspotting  is one of my all time favorite books  I had to read the first few pages over and over again on my first read just to get the knack of what he was doing  After that  I was  thinking  in that dialect while reading  It was a trip ;586
362;2023-06-12 03:15:00;6.0;I hadn t really thought about the two in context until now  so thank you for that   Between the two Ulysses is still an order of magnitude above BM in complexity and difficulty to read   BM has a lot more emotional impact  once you start getting the hang of Ulysses it has a lot of pretty funny bits;2328
363;2023-06-14 18:04:00;11.0;I wouldn t call Blood Meridian  stream of consciousness   But then I also don t think it s hard to read  so who knows;1993
364;2023-06-15 16:40:00;11.0;Honestly I can t enjoy reading stream of consciousness and it makes me think its just a pretentious writing style;1674
365;2023-06-12 02:27:00;6.0;It s one of my favorite books  The way he describes scenes and landscapes are always new and amazing   His dialogue makes me think a lot too ;2441
366;2023-06-12 02:04:00;26.0;Always hilarious when people confuse the feeling of  I didn t like it  with the author being pretentious;170
367;2023-06-12 03:45:00;1.0;Yeah  I haven t read it m  but how some people describe it as being worth the struggle  etc  kinda makes me question if it is a little pretentious  Not saying it is  though ;249
368;2023-06-12 02:29:00;4.0;Punctuation is lacking throughout  but once the story really picks up  you ll barely even notice the fact that you just read a full page long sentence with no commas ;1907

374;2023-06-12 02:10:00;2.0;This is the same advice I gave to customers who were interested in reading  A Naked Lunch  ;333
375;2023-06-12 03:48:00;58.0;Every time I ve read his prose  the lack of punctuation has not been a beneficial attribute ;188
376;2023-06-15 18:55:00;14.0;I haven t read Blood Meridian  but in No Country for Old Men it s like 85  clear when it s dialogue vs internal thought vs description ;1822
377;2023-06-12 03:18:00;10.0;I found it be very clear from context what was dialogue and what wasn t  It ll look like this   Did you not save any of your possibles  Sproule said   The kid spat and shook his head  He looked at Sproule   How bad is your arm   Imo  it s not at all difficult to follow;487
378;2023-06-12 02:30:00;7.0;It takes some getting used to but once you align with his prose  you ll understand how it enables ultra realistic imagery that perfectly complements the austere and violent events he describes ;776
379;2023-06-12 03:00:00;11.0;I have had the same experience with this book  I decided to try two very famous  and very different  Westerns  this book and Lonesome Dove  I remember starting Blood Meridian  spending way to much time on the first page and thinking it might take me longer than Lonesome Dove in the end  despite the wayyy smaller page count       Anyway  I was thinking that when I get back to Blood Meridian  I might just try to read 10 pages without stopping  even if I don t get it  and then see if there s a sense of getting it that develops throughout  If yes  go back and re read it with that new perspective context gained  10 pages or more  whatever it takes   hopefully not the whole book  Ahah   I have had to make that plan because like you  I pause movies when i need to think  and I actually stop songs and Google the lyrics if I don t get it when I want to   it s harder for some people than others to accept to continue something when they don t completely understand what they currently have  I m one of those too  ;304
380;2023-06-12 04:00:00;4.0;its not always super easy to parse what s dialogue and what s prose  but trust the instinct that led you to question the jarring shift from third person to second person  you were right  we switched from setting the scene to basically being the boy  listening to his drunk father talk about the night of his birth ;2088
381;2023-06-12 02:16:00;1.0;I read this book slowly and I would reread sentences or paragraphs a few times sometimes before moving onto the next one  but rather than in frustration I would try and be very chill and curious about them  almost like untying a little knot and figuring out where the place to pull is that makes it all open up  It s not a race  there s no prize  and if you can enjoy the experience of unraveling it I will say I did find it to be a great read  I also found it helpful to circle back after each chapter and re read the little synopsis of events that begin each chapter  Before reading the chapter it s practically like a cipher and after the chapter it usually makes a lot of sense  It s very cool ;561
382;2023-06-15 19:01:00;7.0;McCarthy s style is much closer to Faulkner s than Joyce s  Ulysses was just the first example of stream of consciousness that came to mind ;2268
383;2023-06-15 19:03:00;28.0;Stream of consciousness is an acquired taste  just like Brussels sprouts  you might grow to enjoy it  but every once in a while  you re reminded that it s a little similar to someone farting in your mouth ;1697
384;2023-06-11 21:31:00;12.0;I like McCarthy  but when an artist makes something as complicated and hard to follow as possible as a stylistic choice it s easy to come off as pretentious  I don t think anyone who dislikes Twilight would call it pretentious  but people do call someone like David Foster Wallace or David Lynch films pretentious ;788
385;2023-06-09 17:36:00;5.0;My favorite thing about the pacing and cadence of McArthy s writing is when one of those crazy long run on sentences ends with a sudden description of shocking violence  It s the closest thing to a jump scare that s ever landed on me while reading ;2000
386;2023-06-08 21:19:00;1.0;I ll try to find the list but words like bepopulate and blackeyed  Words that he s put together that you can parse the meaning of but aren t strictly speaking words you find in the dictionary ;1807
387;2023-06-06 06:50:00;2.0;The wasn t my intention I m sorry  All they can really do is take it slow or read other similar materials that are a bit easier for them  I m not really like that  Sorry again if that s the tone you got ;1020
388;2023-06-06 15:30:00;3.0;Do it  Absolutely incredible book with brutal violence described as if it s normal  McCarthy is an exceptional writer ;2186
389;2023-06-04 13:55:00;6.0;  Maybe the best way I ve heard someone explain it  If you ve listened or read any of Joyce s love letters to his wife  you would know that he would have appreciated it  haha ;447
390;2023-06-02 05:16:00;3.0;McCarthy is not that complicated or hard to follow  at least eventually  And I don t think it s necessarily a stylistic choice so much as a content choice  His prose is close to poetry  Also  I d agree that Wallace is pretentious as fuck  but you re not getting away with using that word to describe Lynch  Lynch knows exactly what he s doing  and it s always beautiful  in its way ;1533
391;2023-06-02 20:52:00;9.0;Yeah  but that s the issue I m pointing out  People are very quick to jump on anything somewhat complex and label it as  pretentious   Obviously they sometimes  are  pretentious  but a lot of the time these accusations come off more as  I didn t really like it  or  I didn t really get it  and the person doesn t want to just say that  It s the sour grapes  so to speak;936

408;2023-05-27 17:11:00;18.0;Yesterday  I finished reading  The Pre Raphaelite Language of Flowers  by Debra N  Mancoff  and I could not recommend it more  At only around 80 pages  and with half of those pages being paintings  it is a very quick read  but extremely rich in content  I ve always been fascinated with symbolism in figurative art  and this book focuses on the meanings of flowers in the artwork of the Pre Raphaelite Brotherhood  one of my favorite artistic associations ever   One of the principles of the Brotherhood was to study nature so that it might be effectively represented in their artwork  The importance of nature is emphasized in paintings like  Spring  by Millais and  The Soul of the Rose  by Waterhouse  Throughout the book  Mancoff introduces readers to the Victorian and medieval symbolism associated with various flowers  from the heliotrope and sunflower to the rose and daisy  This use of flowers  combined with the characters  results in every piece of art effectively presenting a narrative  Even if the viewer is unaware of the exact narrative behind the painting  the sense of symbolism is obvious  and one can be assured that this is art that  means something    Another principle of the Brotherhood was the belief that art should have a level of spiritual integrity and heartfeltness  Mancoff s commentary in this book does a great job of introducing the reader to what these artworks meant to their creators and commissioners  Whether it is the sorrow of  Broken Vows  by Calderon  the maternal patriotism of  Queen Victoria With Prince Arthur  by Winterhalter  the aestheticism of  Sunflowers and Hollyhocks  by Hayllor  or the real life romances and scandals behind  Ellen Terry  by Watts or the Portraits of Georgiana Burne Jones and Mary Zambaco  by Edward Burne Jones  this is more than just a showcase of pretty pictures  but a glimpse into the lives of some of the Victorian era s greatest artists ;58

415;2023-05-27 18:59:00;2.0;I rarely see a good breakdown of these books  Something that should be noted is that these texts are often researched by philosophy students on the subject of nominalism  Carroll was a metaphysical realist  I e material vs universals  and Carroll felt that  and rightly so  that the western world was steeped in Nominalism which pissed him off as a mathematician    Both books explore words since Nominalism states that words  numbers  don t represent a universal form   A table shaped as a circle is less real than the idea of a circle    So what Carroll was trying to show was a world without universals  Alice s name makes no sense because what does an  Alice  look like  Humpty Dumpty points out that his name describes what he looks like    Think about what Alice falls asleep thinking about in the first book   What is the use of a book without pictures    Words vs universals    What is justice if words mean whatever we want    Does everything we say have to have a moral point  if not  why do we use words when we aren t making moral points    the jabberwocky  you read words that are gibberish and yet can hear a story about a hero lopping off the head of a beast  However  if you actually looked up the words as to their definition  it describes badgers drilling into the side of a hill  He was extracting meaning out of words and showing that we prescribe universals beyond their definition    He s entire point was that universals exist whether we wish they didn t    But there is also a lot of cultural and  political critique from the time he lived but I see that as a side note more than anything ;1473

439;2023-05-28 13:57:00;41.0;Has anyone else experienced serious whiplash when moving from one author to another   Earlier this week I finished Blood Meridian by McCarthy and as much as I enjoyed the book I felt I needed something lighter afterwards  Going through my to read collection  I chose Oathbringer by Brandon Sanderson knowing it d be lighter in tone and an easier read   What I didn t expect was the shift between authors to be so impactful  It s almost unpleasant   Prose between authors is an obvious difference  I struggled getting into Blood Meridian because of McCarthy s writing style  A lot of information is conveyed in very few words while artful descriptions paint the journey of the kid  Returning to Sanderson has been easy because his style is so direct and conventional  Sanderson takes his time to explore character feelings and remind readers of previous moments  What Sanderson spends three pages holding our hand through  McCarthy throws down with a single paragraph and expects us to clean it up   I m not saying either author has a better style of story telling  But jumping from one to the other makes apparent the different writing styles  I m almost bored reading Oathbringer because it takes Sanderson so long to reach the point   However  it s the approach to violence from both authors that s really affected me    McCarthy s depiction of violence is sickening  It s vivid  horrible  upsetting  unrelenting  and overwhelming at times  When the kid witnesses someone being clubbed in the head  the reader is going to experience what it s like to see someone being brained  Meanwhile Sanderson depicts violence as a morally bad  but an ultimately dismissible aspect of life for his characters  Early in Oathbringer one of Dalinar s chapters features him cutting his way through an army  Dalinar just slices and dices the enemy without a care  Soldiers are dying left and right but that s the extent of all we hear  He then wipes his sword of blood and quips to himself before carrying onto the next plot point   Going from a brutal description of someone being maimed to a handwavey  and he defeated the whole  army not wearing armour because he s so cool  you guys  has really caught me off guard  It s almost like violence is trivialised now  whereas before it was reveled   These novels are completely different  They have different levels of engagement aimed at vastly different audiences  But jumping from one to the other has really caused me to think about different writing approaches  We re not comparing apples and oranges  we re comparing apples and chicken nuggets   Has anyone else experienced this  What authors gave you whiplash when jumping between the two ;935
440;2023-05-28 16:40:00;103.0;  I m not saying either author has a better style of story telling   I am lol;1299
441;2023-05-27 16:25:00;5.0;I was reading In Search of Lost Time and Suttree at the same time   ;299
442;2023-05-27 22:10:00;8.0;If I m reading something with really high quality prose writing  it is pretty jarring to switch to something more mediocre  I m in a book club and mostly like what we read  but it sometimes tends to be more light  romance y  and less  literary  than I prefer  so I ve definitely felt that whiplash  The most recent whiplash event was following up Elena Ferrante s  My Brilliant Friend  with Casey McQuiston s  One Last Stop     One Last Stop  wasn t bad  per se  but it wasn t anything special and couldn t come close to  My Brilliant Friend  ;1521
443;2023-05-28 10:38:00;42.0; I m almost bored reading Oathbringer because it takes Sanderson so long to reach the point   That s not why you re bored ;777
444;2023-05-28 08:23:00;19.0;It s not really an apples vs oranges choice   More like a rare bloody steak vs a bag of powdered mini donuts ;1005
445;2023-05-30 20:17:00;27.0;Well  McCarthy is better  If you keep reading better writers  and you can do better than McCarthy  too  you re going to realise you can t read Sanderson  and generic fantasy in general ;387
446;2023-05-28 23:20:00;24.0;Going from a good writer to a really bad one will do that to you;2197
447;2023-05-28 06:27:00;18.0;In awe at the trash comments under this post  McCarthy is one of the most viscerally expressive writers of all time  and his brutalistic style captures a bleak and hopeless tone better than anyone else I ve ever read  But if you lack the capacity to express that sentiment without merely dragging down another writer  then you re in no place to be making judgements about the quality of  anyone  s prose    Let s ignore for a moment the entirely defensible position that Sanderson is actually a great writer in his own right  Let s pretend he s truly and objectively a mere amateur  Even then  the idea that people shouldn t read Sanderson because  better  writers exist is deranged  I don t think you ve actually considered what you re saying  Do you think Sanderson s novels would be  better  if they were written by McCarthy  Do you think McCarthy s writing style would lend itself to these sorts of stories  Or is it that you think these stories don t deserve to exist at all  That everyone who enjoys them has just been fooled  hasn t had their eyes opened yet   Maybe you should consider whether or not it s possible that the medium is enriched by variety  and that the world can contain both The Road  and  Mistborn without either being lessened  If you disagree with  that   then you must have stumbled onto this subreddit by accident  because you d have to really hate books as an art form to feel that way ;425
448;2023-05-28 08:25:00;5.0;This is how I felt going from reading The Secret History to reading Wheel of Time  The difference in prose was jarring ;2171
449;2023-05-28 17:00:00;2.0;why is everyone and their mother reading blood meridian recently ;1618
450;2023-05-28 11:43:00;12.0;Sanderson has no authorial voice  and  if he has a personality  certainly doesn t bother infusing his writing with it  His prose reads like it s AI generated    He is doing a disservice to the fantasy genre by adding generic and trite bricks to a genre already filled with generic and trite bricks    If you want fantasy  go read Patricia McKillip ;915
451;2023-05-30 20:21:00;1.0;This is the reason I can t get into Sanderson s books  I read the first of the Mistborn and that s it  The write is definitely YA ;701
452;2023-05-28 14:10:00;4.0;I really don t understand how you didn t see this coming  Cormac McCarthy is one of the most accomplished and respected authors of the 20th 21st century  Brandon Sanderson on the other hand makes Jim Theis seem like an accomplished author ;1751

454;2023-05-28 09:59:00;0.0;Sanderson is a glorified content creator  There are plenty of lighter things than McCormac that aren t this  If you want fantasy with style try Ursula Le Guin or Guy Gavriel Kay;1445
455;2023-05-27 22:13:00;-6.0;Oh God here comes the McCarthy obnoxious fans who think they re better    Sanderson s stories and writing style is way better  No one said he s a literary expert but not everyone wants that ;729
456;2023-05-27 23:56:00;-8.0;Brandon Sanderson did an AMA here  you might want to take a look  http   www reddit com r books comments 2ytg2h im novelist brandon sanderson ama            Here s a link to all of our upcoming AMAs  http   www reddit com r books wiki amafullschedule    I am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r books  if you have any questions or concerns  ;863
457;2023-05-28 10:32:00;46.0;Yeah  the sort of reflexive  everyone is good in their own style   stuff is mostly nonsense to me  McCarthy is just genuinely superior at the craft of writing  Everything from the word choice to the ideas conveyed is at least a tier above   That they re different doesn t preclude us from making these comparisons  There s a place for Sex and the City and the Sopranos both  But it s absurd to never be able to say  The Sopranos is the superior HBO series  ;2141
458;2023-05-28 11:42:00;20.0;I ve never read a Sanderson book    but I just googled  Oathbringer s  word count and it s   479 000 words          That s the equivalent of starting at  Philosopher s Stone   and ending part way through  Order of the Phoenix   As a single book    The full LOTR trilogy is 481 000   And Tolkien is known to  ramble     Does Sanderson achieve a similar level of world building and story crafting in  Oathbringer  as Tolkien does in LOTR  Does  Oathbringer  read like it could have used a heavy edit  Or are Sanderson fans just glad to have as much Sanderson as possible    His reviews are overall incredibly positive  but so are Colleen Hoover s  so  you know  ;1351

460;2023-05-29 14:15:00;3.0;  you re going to realise you can t read Sanderson  and generic fantasy in general   This might be the dumbest take in here  News flash  some people enjoy different things from you  Maybe I like to have light hearted fantasy that I don t have to think about at the end of the day  Maybe I prefer world building to character building  or vice versa  Maybe I prefer the overall story to how the story is told  I ve read everything from War and Peace  For Whom the Bell Tolls  Sound and the Fury  and other  best  books from  better writers  to a bunch of trashy fantasy and sci fi romps from people nobody has heard of  And nowadays I almost exclusively read fantasy  even generic stuff    Some people also enjoy two different types of things for different reasons  It s like saying   if you keep watching heart wrenching documentaries then you re going to realize you can t watch silly comedies like UHF or Dude Where s My Car   I can watch both back to back and enjoy them both   I really hated Lord of the Rings  because Tolkien described in crazy detail every little thing  I didn t need 2 pages of description of hobbit toes  I love Saul Bellow s books because he describes the characters  personalities and not  as much  how they look or what the drapes in the room look like  But that is what I enjoy  not what is better or worse ;491

465;2023-05-30 23:46:00;3.0; If you want fantasy  go read Patricia McKillip   Where do I start ;1217

485;2023-05-28 19:59:00;9.0;No  I think it s valid to say that McCarthy is better than Sanderson at the craft of writing   even if  you think McCarthy s artistic decisions are worse than Sanderson s    1  McCarthy carefully chooses which words he uses in order to produce certain effects  They are an important tool in his toolbox when he sets about trying to evoke emotions and thoughts in the reader  Sanderson is careless with the words he uses and is therefore unable to use his prose to manage what reactions he evokes in the reader  He has to rely on the narrative he s describing in order to do that  Basically  McCarthy is able to make something sad because the content  and  the way it s described is sad  but Sanderson can only make you feel sad by giving you sad content   2  McCarthy has deliberately chosen a style of writing which you find difficult to penetrate  while Sanderson has mostly accidentally chosen a style of writing which you find easy to penetrate  It s completely valid to say that McCarthy made a bad choice  However  he s still better than Sanderson at the craft of writing  he just made a decision which you believe was bad   Like  imagine if a master carpenter decided to make window panes out of wood instead of glass  You d be valid in saying  this is dumb   but they d  still  be a master carpenter  they d just be a master carpenter who made a dumb decision in terms of how to apply their craft ;1982

488;2023-05-30 11:59:00;6.0;Editor could definitely have cut a load of stuff from the recent Stormlights     At times they read like a science text book from school   It s a series that s gone downhill for me   a shame after such a strong opener ;544
489;2023-05-29 20:03:00;5.0;He s not bad  He s original enough and his writing is structurally sound  It s true that his writing is somewhat dry and some of his books are longer than necessary  but that doesn t make him  bad   I m not in favor of classifying as bad everything that isn t perfect  There are levels of quality  and I think Sanderson is definitely above average for the genre he writes in ;1004

519;2023-05-27 19:50:00;56.0;It would be easy to say that reading might have exposed you to those words previously  and is a fine way to increase your vocabulary  but now that you know them you can take them with you into the next book  and everyday life ;433
520;2023-05-27 21:19:00;337.0;I would consider those all fairly normal  common enough words  except thalidomide  which has little relevance to most people today   BUT I do not think you re remotely stupid for not knowing them  How can you know something if you ve never learned it  I only know those words because at some point I came across them and looked them up  just like you re doing now  The fact that you re reading the book and making an effort to find out what they mean points to intelligence  not a lack of it ;1591
521;2023-05-27 22:27:00;118.0;Vocabulary can never be out of your league  They are just words you have not encountered before    Keep in mind also that it s something else that might be happening where you might actually know some of these words  but not recognize them in text   I would guess that you have heard the word chauvinism in general speech people talk about  a male chauvinist pig   in response to men who think they are better than women  But the word is not spelled phonetically so you don t readily connect the two concepts   To be honest I don t know the definition of thalidomide   The best part about reading is that not only can it expand your understanding of things  it can expand your vocabulary  Edit  thalidomide is a drug and medical things seem to use their own language that s hard to understand ;1131
522;2023-05-27 23:14:00;80.0;You re just learning   That being said  I m a little concerned about you not knowing the word syphilis  I m not sure how old you are  but you should brush up on your knowledge of STDs  Everyone should know those ;2014
523;2023-05-28 01:33:00;51.0;This is all good for you and shows progress  These are words you should know  even in your twenties  No  you are not stupid  but yes  challenge yourself to learn these words  and Carl Sagan is an excellent introduction to elevating your vocabulary  Good luck ;785
524;2023-05-27 16:23:00;17.0;You ve just got the vocabulary of someone that s only read five books  Nothing to be ashamed of   Everyone  even seasoned readers  occasionally has to look up a word  It just happens a lot less often when you re exposed to more ;1984
525;2023-05-27 18:06:00;11.0;We all went through this  some earlier than others that s all   I read a lot as a kid and had the issue all the time  you ve just started  At least you have a phone  I had a heavy dictionnary     It s normal  no one is born with perfect knowledge  And good choice of book btw ;1707
526;2023-05-28 02:14:00;11.0;You learn more words as you keep reading though  so if you keep a dictionary on hand or  ask Alexa Google for the meanings as you read you ll learn and understand even more ;2179

528;2023-05-27 23:30:00;11.0;Don t give up  I was in the same boat a about 8 years ago  I remember being very interested in the premise of Paradise Lost but couldn t read it at all  I tried reading it again 2 years after I started to read more and I was able to follow along perfectly  Enjoy the journey ;666
529;2023-05-28 04:33:00;31.0;Unfortunately  the US education system doesn t really do well with literacy  Punching that list of words into a readability calculator puts them at a 12th grade level  Is it normal  Probably not here in  r books  but 54  of Americans read at below a 6th grade level  so sadly  it is   So the system did you wrong  But that in no way means you are stupid  Lack of education or ignorance is only your fault if you choose to stay that way   Congratulations on choosing to improve yourself  Reading is not only entertainment  it s an incredible tool  It used to be illegal to teach slaves to read for a reason   Sagan is an excellent choice  and I hope you find it worth the struggle ;2404
530;2023-05-27 16:31:00;41.0;A kindle can help  Highlight the word  and it tells you the definition  You can save them for use in flashcards too  Everybody has to start somewhere  When we were children we simply had more stamina for powering through things we didn t quite know yet  so it felt easier  As an adult who is supposed to have it all together we often lack the patience and modesty to continually engage with things that make us feel  stupid   The worst you can do is give up    That being said  I think you are owed at least some candid answer regarding how difficult the vocabulary you mentioned really is in the grand scheme of things  I wouldn t consider any of the words you mentioned complicated or scientific vocabulary  They are the type of vocabulary young adults usually familiarize themselves with during the ages of 10 16  It s highschool level english basically  I am not saying this to discourage you  Far from it  But I do not want to give you a wrong impression of where you stand either  I think it is important to know where you are so you can look out for where you are heading  So keep at it  The fact that you enjoy reading the book regardless of your lack of vocabulary will be a big benefit to you in that regard  Also  maybe pick up some audiobooks  I believe they are quite valuable for picking up vocabulary since you can actually hear someone say the words out loud properly in context  Picking up the meanings of words through context is also a great way to learn them  It usually sticks better than reading up the definition  since your brain needs to actively draw connections to other words and form patterns ;1205

535;2023-05-27 17:10:00;11.0;With this comment you have 100  validated why kids are urged to read   it s the best way of learning new words and the context in which they appear in day to day life    To answer your question  learn all the new words and remember them  It s part of the joy of reading  Next time you ll get to feel smug that you already know them   ;2099
536;2023-05-27 18:30:00;48.0;It s not normal if you re in your mid 20s and English is your first language  You should have come across those words by now  certainly in conversation if not in writing  But the solution is to keep reading ;1429

540;2023-05-27 17:15:00;59.0;Not normal  you are probably lacking some education but its great that you are reading  that will help you improve so much your vocabulary and comprehension  Good for you and keep it up  ;1738
541;2023-05-27 19:29:00;98.0;damn son  your school really failed you    I consider all of these perfectly normal words  and english isn t even my first language   good news is  the BEST way to learn new vocabulary is to read read read  So you re already on a good path  Don t be ashamed of looking up things you don t know  it s literally how you ll learn  When I was a kid reading english books I was too lazy to look up words in the dictionary and went all  oh I ll just guess the meaning from the context  which    worked most of the time I guess  but it also led to misunderstandings that lasted for years   As an adult I now swallow my pride and just google things I don t know  I remember I read Les Mis a few months ago  and some of the 19th century words were too obscure even for me  I kept googling words and historical events people Hugo kept namedropping  just for the sake of understanding all the subtext  and honestly I had more fun than I would have had I not bothered  Also kt felt to me that I retained new information more easily this way  maybe because I was combining learning with something fun  or maybe because it was easier for my brain to make new connotations and burn them into my memory  Either way  give it a try ;628

543;2023-05-27 16:56:00;6.0;It is becoming increasingly common for people to graduate high school with an elementary level reading skill     This means that a sixth grader can read about as well as a high school graduate    I have a ton of political beliefs about intentionally reducing the education of the population to control the mass narrative  but this isn t the place for that discussion    You aren t alone  Your education system failed you and as an adult it is now your responsibility to educate yourself   At university you learn that you never stop learning    Life long learning is understanding that school was simply where you learned how to learn  But these days  you aren t guaranteed to get that lesson    Great advice for new readers      read what interests you  Even if you are a slow reader  even if it is a trashy romance  reading is about practice and if you aren t interested you won t be invested in reading       if you read a page of a book and you find more than 5 words that you don t understand  this book is above your reading level and you should work your way up to it        get an e reader that connects to a dictionary  That way when you find a word that you just can t quite place  you tap the word and the definition is displayed  Really helps when expanding your vocabulary    Your mind is like a muscle  you have to exercise it to develop that strength and practice to get skills   Why did you learn that math that you weren t going to use  History  geography of places you probably won t go  etc   Because that knowledge was the weight you lifted to strengthen your mind    Someone who does not read will lead but a single life  Someone who reads will lead thousands of lives  Their adventures may be hidden inside the pages  but the memories last lifetimes ;2159
544;2023-05-27 18:58:00;7.0;First of all  not knowing something and being stupid are not the same  so no  you aren t stupid  But the book likely is above your current reading level  That said  the way you increase your reading level is to read books above you reading level  I think you should keep pushing through using dictionary com like you have been  It s not the best experience you could have had reading the book  but it s still miles above not reading it at all  And in the future  when these words come up again  either in future reading or in conversation  you ll be ready for them ;2228
545;2023-05-28 03:29:00;5.0;OP just blew my mind  I was very much in the same position in my 20s  I grew up in a household that put zero value on reading or academics  I somehow fumbled my way through college  and man if I wasn t looking up a word every paragraph  As the material got harder  there were more complex words  so still constantly looking up words even though my vocabulary was growing  Even when I stared in a PhD program  I was still doing this    What this post made me realize  is that after years and years of intense reading  the need to look up words fell away so gradually that I didn t even notice  I don t have to look up words anymore  Nobody s gonna read this  but it s a small and personal victory for me that I wouldn t have noticed if not for this post ;246
546;2023-05-28 07:37:00;41.0;You re not stupid  Nobody is born knowing the definitions of every word  and if you don t whip out the phone to look them up  you won t learn  Better to admit the things that you re missing and try to fix them than to struggle in silence  There are so many people who if were confronted with a book like that  they d just stop reading it and blame the book   One thing you can try to do is learn through context clues  Like if you run into a difficult work on a page  instead of immediately looking it up  read the whole paragraph and see if you can piece together what it means  Then look it up and see if you were right  This will help your reading ability and ability to read critically  But keep doing what you re doing  and the next book you read will be easier;2383
547;2023-05-28 15:32:00;18.0;I d say those are all very common words  not just in reading but to hear in TV and movies as well   But I remember what it was like when I was in high school and as a freshman took a senior level English class and suddenly had to look up words seemingly every 3 paragraphs   At first you might feel a little behind  but afterwards you ll feel so good at How much you ve improved your own vocabulary   I ll tell you another series you wouldn t expect to be so dictionary intensive since it s technically a kids book   The  a series of unfortunate events  books   Bruh I read that in hs and felt dumb af like  little kids read this   How do I not k ow some of these words    But now some of the ones I learned there are my favorite words ;1968
548;2023-05-27 19:03:00;44.0;Sorry  but yes it is you  Read more ;2177
549;2023-05-27 23:21:00;19.0;What the fuck  This is depressing  These are extraordinarily common words and not something anyone anywhere would consider advanced or obscure vocabulary  This is sad as fuck  your school and parents utterly failed you  I can t imagine parents who don t read to their kids and get them into reading   Jesus ;1993
550;2023-05-27 21:26:00;28.0;Everyone who knows those words read them  didn t know them  and learned them   So don t feel bad  or discouraged  you re just doing the same thing everyone else did ;2289
551;2023-05-27 19:37:00;5.0;I recognized all those words  but I read a lot   The more you read  the more words you know   I suggest you read on a Kindle   You can hold your finger on words you don t know  and it will give you the definition right there   Makes it easier to look up ;1461
552;2023-05-27 17:45:00;5.0;That book is incredibly formative for the topics covered by it  The fact that you don t know many of the words and look them up to learn their meaning  makes it even more formative for you  You re basically getting double value from this one book   On another note  you re not stupid  People often make the mistake of identifying ignorance with stupidity  The re not the same thing  We re not born with all the knowledge of the world  and taking the chance to learn more is actually a smart move    Keep it up and if you need some rest from reading  I d recommend to watch Cosmos by Sagan  More sciencey stuff and more big words  yes  but then where s the fun in seeing something that you already know ;2406
553;2023-05-27 18:02:00;5.0;Dude  been reading all my life  every day I find new words I don t know   I look them up   Probably don t remember them  and look them up again   It s quite normal   English is an enormous language ;1611

555;2023-05-27 22:24:00;6.0;The Demon Haunted World is a very good book by a very good science communicator   but   his writing was very much tuned to the reading public of his time  It came out in 1995   Thalidomide babies would not have needed any explanation to readers in the 70s  80s  or 90s  but that was a phenomenon of one era  Other words  like chauvinism  have mostly been replaced by other terms these days but still have their meaning and their place   I recently listened to this as an audiobook  and I was very struck by the weird nostalgia of being drawn back to the worldview of my college and immediately post college years   If you can be bothered to hit a dictionary or wikipedia or google for the terms you don t know  you will ramp up so fast by reading this book  Maybe take it in small doses  only a few pages a day   This is normal if you don t read a lot  and I can vouch for the quality of the book  If it s one you enjoy  I am rooting for you to keep going   EDIT   Consider how frequently you get to be one of the lucky 10 000 while reading this book   https   m xkcd com 1053 ;1272

561;2023-05-28 15:23:00;5.0;Not trying to be a dick here but all of those  except for one  are incredibly simple and common words for me  Books by Sagan are usually written so normal people can understand them so they re not terribly advanced books by any measure  At least as far as I ve seen    But you re not a reader and you re learning so that s good but it does seem weird to me that a man in his mid 20s has to look up words like cauterizaci n  cadaver or folly    Again  Not trying to be a dick  You re trying hard and that s great ;4
562;2023-05-27 15:50:00;6.0;No offense  but English is my second language and I know all of the words you gave as an example   yes  you definitely should read more ;1918

564;2023-05-28 10:02:00;45.0;Well  honestly  some of your example words are pretty commonly known words  My husband who is a very casual reader and does not have a high school diploma knew 7 8 of them  So I dunno  perhaps your quality of education was not great  I don t know you    But for sure one of the most commonly cited great benefits of reading is its contribution to vocabulary development  I know that my understanding of high level vocabulary comes from being an avid reader for most of my life  Virtually every  hard  or  uncommon  word I know the definition of and can use correctly comes form books I ve read  And I do have to look up words occasionally  even in my 30s  after a lifetime of reading    Keep going  Nothing wrong with not knowing things  lifelong learning is a great thing ;813

567;2023-05-27 16:58:00;27.0;Well  you re definitely behind if you don t know any of those words  That being said  the best thing is just keep on reading and checking the meaning of words  You will get better ;338

574;2023-05-27 18:58:00;4.0;Totally not trying to be a dick but those are all words you should know  well not thalidomide   It s awesome that your reading a  book that s challenging you and incredible that you have the patience to look up all those words in the dictionary  You re doing awesome  keep doing exactly what you re doing  I used to have a kindle and I could look up words right from the text  It was super helpful and I looked up a lot of words I would have just skipped over if I was reading paper  Probably the kindle app has that ;293
575;2023-05-27 19:18:00;3.0;Remember those vocabulary quizzes in high school  You were expected to actually  retain  those words  Guarantee you some of the words on your list were in there   But hey  at least you re making up for it ;669

578;2023-05-27 19:40:00;26.0;If it helps  I m currently reading the book too   no  you re not at all stupid  Sagan tends to use language that isn t really so conversational  I ve had to look up  a few words myself  and I am an avid reader    Try to think of the book as a challenge  especially as it s not a field in which you are necessarily comfortable  I don t read a lot of science for precisely that reason  it isn t a strong field of knowledge for me  but I want to learn more    Would it help to read it with another person  perhaps  Someone who has a basic idea of what Sagan is talking about and can help you with the terms and references ;85
579;2023-05-27 20:55:00;9.0;You re not stupid  You just have a small vocabulary  That s something you can work on easily by reading more books  Especially books from different eras  by different authors working in different genres   Sagan is a great writer  but he has the vocabulary of a very educated man born before the second world war that spent decades in academia ;794

585;2023-05-28 01:38:00;3.0;Reading is a lot like exercise  It can be hard to get started and sustain your effort  especially if you ve been away from it fir a while  but in time you ll get stronger and faster  it will start to feel more like fun than work  and you ll be proud of the changes within you  Keep at it ;2076
586;2023-05-28 03:25:00;3.0;Don t feel bad  I actually read quite a bit  but mostly fiction that isn t particularly    demanding   I picked up Peachtree Road by Anne Rivers Siddons once  because I was bored and it was the only thing available to read for a while  It was a great book  but good lord does that woman wield her vocabulary like a weapon against less literate readers  I spent some time with a dictionary while reading that book  and I consider myself reasonably literate ;319
587;2023-05-28 04:01:00;3.0;This is actually what s great about reading  You aren t automatically an expert at vocabulary you ve never seen before  but reading more books gets you familiar with the terms and the context  I remember reading  beyond good and evil  by Friedrich Nietzsche and he used a lot of terms and references to things I hadn t heard of  but the book did provide definitions for them at the bottom of each page ;650
588;2023-05-28 04:09:00;3.0;A kindle has been awesome for building my vocabulary  As I m reading I just click on a word and it tells me the definition  I still love physical books  but damn  I m hooked on the kindle pw ;2220
589;2023-05-28 04:34:00;3.0;Lol you re not stupid  this is the process  You re challenged  and you re learning  This is great  Demon Haunted World is not an easy book  Good on you for getting out of your comfort zone  If you keep it up  you ll be amazed at where you re at in a year ;878
590;2023-05-28 04:37:00;3.0;No matter how many words you know  you will be able to find  pretty easily  a book that contains lots that you don t know   I can easily see not knowing syphilis  we just don t talk about it   thalidomide  cauterization  cadavers      if you don t spend a lot of time either reading  about or listening to science and or medicine  And if you chiefly listen  then when you go to read them you discover that they don t look like they sound  Many times you can figure out what a word means just by how it fits into a sentence  For example   Tom chiefly listened to books rather than read them   That s pretty clearly either  mainly  or  occasionally   sure  there are more guesses you could make  but how much sense do they really make   but a  chief  is a boss  not someone you can ignore   As to the others  it s just a matter of what you re used to  As you read more  you ll meet more of them and get more comfortable with them    Note also that as you get used to them  you ll also speak and write them more frequently  This may mean that family and friends think you re getting snobby and  putting on airs   but strangers will automatically think you re smarter and more competent  The key to success in life is to know your audience and speak write appropriately for them  And of course  you ll laugh all the more at  The Rivals   William Brinsley Sheridan  ;339
591;2023-05-28 05:40:00;3.0;Your usage of English grammar says you aren t stupid   You are just ignorant   Ignorance can be cured with knowledge   Unfortunately  not all the knowledge in the world can make someone less stupid   Read more  pursue the things you have interests in  and watch your ignorance lessen and your knowledge grow    Congrats on becoming a reader    Hit up some used book stores   You might find a gold mine  ;2344
592;2023-05-28 07:03:00;3.0;You are reading a challenging book for your vocab level   good for you   Don t worry about if it s normal   Only whether you re enjoying the read   If it becomes a chore  set it aside for now   Otherwise just go for it   Looking up words is a perfectly legitimate way to learn words ;84
593;2023-05-28 07:17:00;3.0;I recently read On Writing by Stephen King  part memoir and part writing guide   and one of my favorite ideas he presents is about the idea that we need to fully understand everything read  He compares reading to listening to music and how he can enjoy a song without understanding everything in it  As someone who often mishears or cannot make out the words in songs but still routinely loves it anyway  this was a revelation to me and I intend to adopt King s perspective   It really speaks to King s strength as a writer how much that comparison struck me  So often I give myself a hard time without really thinking about it when I m struggling through a book  but I wouldn t care if I enjoy an album without even knowing what it s  actually  about  If you enjoy reading something  then who cares if you don t get every detail  Is it create an atmosphere  Are you entertained  Do you like how it makes you feel  If so  keep going  You ll get better in the process ;1511
594;2023-05-28 07:22:00;3.0;This was actually a selling point for a lot of e readers   I grew up reading physical books  before  cellphones and computers were a thing  So I was left to wonder what that word meant  pull out a dictionary  or ask someone if they knew    It got easier the more I read because I learned new words and guessed what they meant in context  Sometimes I was wrong  A lot of times I pronounced them wrong    Then I got a nook  And it had this nifty feature where you could highlight a word and get the definition right away  Things made more sense faster    It did not look so good when I picked up a physical book and tried to do the same thing   ;560
595;2023-05-28 07:42:00;3.0;Maybe you should try reading the books in the  A Series of Unfortunate Events  series  He uses a lot of weird words  and explains what they mean as part of the story ;1792
596;2023-05-28 07:48:00;3.0;You may not be dumb but your list of words surprised me especially syphilis  chiefly  cauterize  folly and cadavers  Thalidomide i know because my parents are bright and would talk to me about serious topics so I ve known since a young age but your younger than me and it s a drug that s been banned a long time now  I knew all of them but have read very few books however I do read a LOT of Reddit and have seen all those in use  It s not reading but rather I know them from watching TV  I liked adult stuff on tv as a kid so I d be exposed to those words  I dont think your stupid  A stupid person would likely not be reading Sagan at all and wouldn t bother to look everything up  I applaud you ;915
597;2023-05-28 08:48:00;3.0;Bruh those words I ve known since I was super young but I grew up with a love for medical things and researching the human body etc when bored  So long as you know more common stuff don t worry;842
598;2023-05-28 09:38:00;3.0;Just keep looking up words you don t know  Avid childhood readers often do this  it just feels weird as an adult because we think we know more than we do  The written English language is a carnival  enjoy the ride ;513
599;2023-05-28 09:50:00;3.0;OP s lack of reading ability was done to him intentionally by our government s education policies  Good for you OP  Just look up words when needed and have fun ;1604
600;2023-05-28 10:45:00;3.0;Bro you have barely read at all and now you re reading a book by one of the most educated people to ever live  no shit you re gonna come across some unfamiliar words;435
601;2023-05-28 11:59:00;3.0;You ve now discovered why it s recommended that kids read regularly   You might want to scale your reading targets back a bit  if you re having trouble with the vocabulary then Sagan might be a bit more difficult  dude was a world renowned scientist for a reason   What kind of books shows do you like to read watch  I might be able to recommend something you ll enjoy reading ;609
602;2023-05-28 15:13:00;3.0;I and most folks would probably know all of the examples you gave  The ebook with a quick lookup feature ides is a good one  It s what finally sold me on moving away from paper and ink   I always appreciate it when an author throws in a new word for me to learn ;1166
603;2023-05-28 15:58:00;3.0;First of all  glad you re reading  Our world is so much larger when you can jump into a book and basically  be  somewhere else    Can I make a suggestion  Get a kindle  I know this is a book subreddit but kindles have built in dictionaries and you just have to tap and hold on a word you don t know and it will pop up a definition for you    I LOVE physical books  So so SO much but my kindle is a great tool when I encounter a difficult book with a lot of words I don t know  It s really helpful and useful to have the dictionary built in    You can also do this with the kindle app on your phone but I hate reading that way personally    Good luck ;1436
604;2023-05-28 12:14:00;3.0;Those are words which are well known to those who read a lot  The way we get larger vocabularies is largely by reading  so you missed out some  Sorry  But keep reading  you ll learn the words and understand more easily  even by the end of the book  because authors have favorite words that they use a lot   I m glad you like Carl Sagan  He s a great guy to give a big picture understanding of science ;1971
605;2023-05-28 10:46:00;3.0;This is basically how people improve vocabulary in thier native language   After you do this for a while  you ll realize that you have to be cautious about who you use your wider vocabulary with  as not everyone will know the words you know   Tip  anytime you want to do something you ve never done before  just read about how to do it first  Makes like easy mode because you don t have to  figure out  most things  you can just learn from those who already figured it out and save your brainpower ;1449
606;2023-05-27 16:13:00;3.0;Congrats for starting with something so worthy of your attention  Excellent choice   The more you read the more you ll enhance and enlarge your vocabulary and knowledge  Soon you ll amaze yourself with how much you know about so many things  Keep up the good work ;992
607;2023-05-28 08:09:00;3.0;I know these words  so I think you just need to improve your vocab ;2145
608;2023-05-27 17:22:00;3.0;I m curious about what books you ve read up to this point and how you managed to dodge reading books your whole life   Keep it up   Words hard  learning good ;1672
609;2023-05-28 03:56:00;3.0;With the exception of thalidomide  those are all examples of basic vocabulary one would be expected to learn in a high school education  You can still learn now  Download an English vocab app and practice ;205
610;2023-05-28 09:13:00;3.0;I don t want to be rude  but for comparison  I understand most of these words and English isn t even my first language ;2303
611;2023-05-27 16:13:00;3.0;I went to grade school before the internet was on phones do they still teach context clues   Honest question;702
612;2023-05-27 16:38:00;3.0;Dude your vocabulary sucks the examples you gave aren t that obscure but this is why reading is important;970
613;2023-05-27 16:59:00;3.0;Pro Tip  Invest in a nice college level printed dictionary  I find that when you go through the process of flipping the pages and searching provides a mnemonic hook which helps you remember it long term  Also  as a bonus you get distracted and lear a lot of other cool words along the way ;348
614;2023-05-27 17:16:00;3.0;Out of curiosity  which country are you from  what is your level of education and what do you do for a living  I would assume you d learn cadaver  folly  credulity and chauvinism in high school ;2196
615;2023-05-27 17:30:00;3.0;No time the present to start expanding your vocabulary ;2383
616;2023-05-27 17:33:00;3.0;This is why people day  go read a book  as an insult  It will expand your vocab  Just pause and look up the words  Eventually you will get to the point where new words makes sense because of the context on the sentence ;2035
617;2023-05-27 17:40:00;3.0;Syphilis    It s concerning that you don t know what syphilis is ;841
618;2023-05-27 17:41:00;3.0;This is actually one of the main reasons I absolutely love my Kindle  When I come across a word I don t know  I just press it and get the definition immediately  It s amazing;615
619;2023-05-27 17:50:00;3.0;I want to commend you for bettering yourself and your vocabulary   But to honestly and gently answer your question   I would consider all of those listed examples to be fairly regular  normal words   That they seemed foreign to you either means you need help with the transition from text to sound  because you had to have heard some of them before  or it means you have a vocabulary and exposure to non conversational english akin to someone that doesn t speak fluent english ;34
620;2023-05-27 17:51:00;9.0;Those are all very simple words my man  Maybe stick to Nancy drew or goosebumps ;193
621;2023-05-27 18:53:00;9.0;I mean   chauvinism  syphilis and cadavers hardly are difficult words to understand   right  Right  ;1227
622;2023-05-27 18:55:00;8.0;You could try reading on the kindle app on an iPad  They have a built in dictionary that you can use as you read       Also  maybe I recommend something a little more light vocabulary wise  I always recommend  Pet Semetary  by Stephen King  It s great       Edit  Carl Sagan was a physicist  and as a physicist myself  I must say he was one of the more linguistically fluid physicists  I d compare his speech to a Shakespeare of the 1980s ;269
623;2023-05-27 18:57:00;6.0;That s called being a dummy;1184
624;2023-05-27 18:57:00;4.0;If you havent read much  its totally understandable that a lot of words aren t going to be familiar to you  That s not stupidity  it s ignorance  and I d rather be ignorant every day of the week  The more you read  the less you ll have to Google as your vocabulary gets larger  It s a good feeling  you ll enjoy it  Keep going ;1832
625;2023-05-27 18:58:00;3.0;Don t blame yourself but yeah  you didn t have a great education ;1423
626;2023-05-27 19:02:00;4.0;Yeah that would be the end result of not reading ;2224
627;2023-05-27 19:03:00;2.0;That s usually fine   If you want other book that as themes of etymology  history   science of words    I would suggest Babel    Sagan may have been a bit too extreme of a jump but if you can get through that you ll be flying through some other stuff;243
628;2023-05-27 19:03:00;2.0;If you get a Kindle  they re like a hundred bucks  you can hold a word on the screen and it ll give you it s dictionary definition  I started using it reading Terry Pratchett and it shocked me how many words that I thought were just cleverly invented words he had made were actually just rarely used words that I didn t know ;1157
629;2023-05-27 19:07:00;2.0;That s one of my favorite books  and I read it the same way    Carry on  The magic of reading is the ability to learn  The only person being enriched who cares is yourself  Read on  stay curious  persevere ;518
630;2023-05-27 19:12:00;2.0;I m always looking up words when I read  It s normal  especially for dense texts  I just keep looking them up over and over again  like flashcards  until they  stick  ;1641
631;2023-05-27 19:12:00;2.0;Great book to read  It will change your outlook on the universe    Good for you  Way to power through ;1191
632;2023-05-27 19:12:00;2.0;Keep it up  I read a ton and still look up words on occasion  You re just becoming more literate  I m impressed you re tackling stuff like Sagan while not being much of a reader  That s pretty cool ;723
633;2023-05-27 19:14:00;2.0;You won t understand them until you look them up  Keep it up  Before long  you really won t be looking up so many words anymore  you ll just understand them ;1391
634;2023-05-27 19:14:00;2.0;I m kind of the opposite of you     I ve been a reader every since I learned how     I got into science books at about age 10 or 11  and didn t understand a lot of the words either     This was before the internet  so I kept a dictionary close at hand   Sometimes  I got sidetracked and read the dictionary instead of the book I was reading     My vocabulary grew because I was reading     Sure  I was where you are at now at a younger age  So what     This isn t a race     You re not behind  just on a different track     I hope you enjoy an expanding world  There s a lot out there  have fun ;698
635;2023-05-27 19:14:00;2.0;I highly recommend downloading books from your library    You can touch words you don t know and it will give you the meaning;41
636;2023-05-27 19:15:00;2.0;Yea  that s exactly why reading is beneficial  Over time you build familiarity with more words and ideas  To be fair medication   disease names  thalidomide  syphilis  are a bit specific    though you should definitely know about STDs  Anyway good on you for putting in the mental labor  All those words you mentioned may be used less often but should be somewhere in your mental lexicon ;1549
637;2023-05-27 19:25:00;2.0;Your problem is reading books   Your solution is to read MORE books  It s absolutely the right thing to do  to whip out your phone  There s nothing wrong with not knowing something  Ignorance that is bad  IMO   is not caring and not learning   Find authors you like  I mostly like sci fi and fantasy  myself ;1383
638;2023-05-27 19:25:00;2.0;Keep up with your reading eventually you ll be able to wade through the technobabble word salad of some of the greatest sci fi books   The very act of reading is learning  Sometimes it s new words  sometimes it s the concepts  Don t feel bad about learning   ;1152
639;2023-05-27 19:37:00;2.0;I m middle aged  have a degree in English literature and still look up words regularly   Learning new words  phrases  geography  etc   is part of what makes reading so worthwhile ;1943
640;2023-05-27 19:41:00;2.0;You ll learn don t worry  I d look into a Kindle because it s really convenient to long tap on words you don t know and open the dictionary  Happy reading ;1727
641;2023-05-27 19:47:00;2.0;Honestly its just showing an opportunity to expand your vocabulary  it is one of the best part about reading  as far as self improvement  that and empathy   Find an unknown word    See how its used in context  look up the definition  and now youve expanded uour vocabulary  Bonus points for figuring out the correct pronunciation so its more comprehensible;2333
642;2023-05-27 20:02:00;2.0;You re not stupid at all  I still do this  even after being a regular reader for decades  I ve grown to enjoy it     It s the best way to expand your vocabulary  through doing something you enjoy   If you ever want a real challenge  try the Aubrey Maturin novels  He uses genuine 19th C  nautical terms throughout ;260
643;2023-05-27 20:12:00;2.0;I had this issue when I went through this phase of reading a lot of Victorian books  using kindle helped because I could just hold down the word and get a quick dictionary definition;610
644;2023-05-27 20:15:00;2.0;Keep with it friend  It ll get easier as you go along  You got this ;366
645;2023-05-27 20:16:00;2.0;Dont worry about it  you re in your mid 20 s and expanding your vocabulary  totally normal to learn new words and expand ones knowledge of language as one matures   The fact you are taking the time to learn new words as you read this book is a sign of intellect and curiosity  be proud of yourself ;991
646;2023-05-27 20:17:00;2.0;When reading things on a Kindle and I assume other e readers and tablets  tap and hold will give the definition of a word   Thats the easiest way   In the olden days when I was a kid  I had a paperback dictionary   If you own the book  a pencil highlighter  is ideal  especially if you want to keep reading  Highlight and dog ear or small bookmark   If you have a smart phone Google works fine   Type in the word and definition   Good vocabulary builders are thinks like Word a day calenders  word puzzles and just continuing to read   Google  vocabulary builder    When reading I often would guess at a similar meaning close to the word in question because of the context and usage   I wish there was an all fandoms dictionary app that would allow me to immediately figure it out    Sorry for all the big words     Good luck and keep reading ;913
647;2023-05-27 20:17:00;2.0;This is how readers broaden their vocabulary   Keep it up ;841
648;2023-05-27 20:17:00;2.0;That s how you build vocabulary   Keep reading and you ll keep growing   If you read with a Kindle or Kindle app  you can tap on words and get instant dictionary lookup   I really like that feature   Other reading apps probably have that feature ;2365
649;2023-05-27 20:19:00;2.0;I ve read hundreds of books and have multiple degrees but I still look up words in my dictionary app just about every book I read ;892
650;2023-05-27 21:20:00;2.0;It is normal  if you haven t read lots of books  Just continue to read  to google terms when necessary  and soon enough it will come to you  There is no need to worry ;2101
651;2023-05-27 21:30:00;2.0;Yes  but it also depends on the genre of book you re reading  especially if it specializes in a certain area  If you re reading about a geologist obviously there s going to be a lot of specialization so you may not now  Just keep reading on  ;302
652;2023-05-27 21:46:00;2.0;The whole point of reading is to expand your mind  If you re not understanding some words  take it as a win when you look them up  You re expanding your brain  and those words will never be a mystery again    You re doing great  and I m proud of you  Keep up the good work ;2026
653;2023-05-27 21:48:00;2.0;Nothing wrong with not knowing or not having been exposed to a wider vocabulary  Some things you may have seen before but they just didn t sink in  Keep reading and the world will open up in amazing new ways  Totally recommend just walking into your local library and telling the librarian   I m interested in  insert topic  but I m just starting to work on expanding my vocabulary  What do you recommend as an intro book   They ll be super excited to help  Also  if you re enjoying science but want a more sort of user friendly author  highly recommend Brian Greene  He s got some talks online as well as great books  I find seeing the author talk helps me read their work in their rhythm and style  it lets me get more just from context ;775
654;2023-05-27 21:51:00;2.0;When I was younger and really in the transformation of learning how to read  we had assignments that had you write out words you didn t understand while reading and then defining them and using them in a sentence   All that to say  it is very normal  Just keep going  It ll get easier and better as you continue ;24
655;2023-05-27 21:59:00;2.0;you aren t stupid at all  you can t know a word if you haven t been exposed to it  intelligence doesn t factor into that ;2180
656;2023-05-27 22:01:00;2.0;Look into a kindle  You can borrow digital books from your library for free  but the nice thing about the Kindle is that you can press on any word and the definition comes up  If you like fiction  choose some popular  young adult  books that sound interesting  Many books that are labeled as young adult still have adult themes and language  Those books will also have a slightly easier vocabulary ;1355
657;2023-05-27 22:03:00;2.0;I ve been reading since I was like 6 and I m 35 now  and I still have to whip out a dictionary occasionally  Honestly it s one of the best things about regular reading imo is that it expands your vocabulary and teaches you while you re doing something enjoyable   That you re running into a bunch of new words now as someone just getting into regular reading is nothing to worry about or be embarrassed by  Think of it like cooking  when you first move from making boxed meals to cooking from scratch you ll look at all the ingredients and spices and have no idea what they are or how to use them  but over time you ll pick up and learn the roles and uses of each  Reading is much the same  unusual  obscure or even downright weird words are our spices and it s going to be a learning process to see how they re used or what they even mean  But in doing so you enrich your vocabulary  your ability to express thoughts and ideas and your understanding of things you might not have even known there were words for ;932
658;2023-05-27 22:09:00;2.0;One tip I would offer is to keep a journal of words you don t know and look up and physically write them down along with the definition and maybe write a sentence or two with them  It really helps to lock them in my brain  I have a moleskine journal for jotting stuff down and when I encounter a word I m not sure about  I write it down with the definition ;47
659;2023-05-27 22:12:00;2.0;Invest in a dictionary  Those words are all understandable ;455
660;2023-05-27 22:28:00;2.0;I have been reading all my life and I encounter words I have never seen on a weekly basis  It s fun to learn new words  I really think it s one of the best parts of reading  There s zero shame in it and it s 100  normal ;641
661;2023-05-27 22:32:00;2.0;Good for you  those failures  words you don t know  will challenge you and make you a better reader ;944
662;2023-05-27 22:42:00;2.0;Keep at it  Trying to expand your knowledge is the exact opposite of stupid ;1928
663;2023-05-27 22:43:00;2.0;My grandpa would read with a dictionary next to him  and any word he came across that he didn t know  he d look it up   This can also be done with ebooks and the like  I personally do the same  makes reading even more of a learning experience ;1596
664;2023-05-27 22:47:00;2.0;You re not stupid  not at all  How can you be expected to know things you haven t exposed yourself too   It seems to me like you re having a shame based reaction to not knowing something  Instead  I would encourage you to cultivate your curiosity  That way  when you run into something new  or that you don t know  or don t understand  the thought inside your head won t be  Why don t I understand this  Am I dumb   Instead it will be something more like  Oh I wonder what this is  Can t wait to find out  ;372
665;2023-05-27 22:52:00;2.0;This doesn t mean you re stupid   It means your vocabulary isn t so great   BTW  if you have  or get  a tablet  you can get a free Kindle App   There are zillions of digital books to be had   Libraries have free ones  just like regular books  that you can download for a few weeks   If you run into a word you don t know  you press on it to  highlight it   Most of the time  the definition pops up in a separate sub window   I still do that with words I have  some  understanding of  but want a clearer one   It s one of the good things about reading a digital book   Another is that your tablet   or phone  or computer  can hold a LOT of books    Yes  you could buy a dedicated Kindle  which is an Amazon product designed for digital books that have the correct digital format   I have 2  but I like my tablet just as well  AND it can do a lot of things that the Kindle reader can t    Also BTW  since most people are pretty used to reading things on their phone  you can get the kindle app for your phone  and read books on that  too ;2374
666;2023-05-27 22:53:00;2.0;The world you listed arent uncommon  but I have to admit they are words I m more familiar with from reading than conversation  Props for taking the effort to read and the time to learn words you don t know  If you re going to continue it may be worth it to get an e reader  I ve been using a Kindle for years  and they have a built in dictionary  When I see a word I m not sure of i tap on it and it takes me straight to the definition ;663
667;2023-05-27 22:54:00;2.0;When you go to the gym  you build muscles  among other things that happen  and it shows    When you read  you build vocabulary  among other things  and it will show  Reading is your mind s gym ;566
668;2023-05-27 23:02:00;2.0;People who are avid readers do know these words  but we didn t at first   You learn by reading a lot so keep it up   Reading is the best thing for your education  knowledge  critical thinking and more ;157
669;2023-05-27 23:02:00;2.0;That s great  You re definitely not stupid  ;1886
670;2023-05-27 23:15:00;2.0;This is how you expand your vocabulary   Since I read on a Kindle  I can just click on a word to get the definition   It s great ;2354
671;2023-05-27 23:16:00;2.0;Reading is how ya learn words in the first place  Or at least  it s how I did   Back in my day we didn t have phone dictionaries either  so we kinda just eventually intuited their meaning from the contexts ins which they were used ;781
672;2023-05-27 23:16:00;2.0;It s how we learn  keep going   I had to buy a latin dictionary read some of Umberto ecos books    No shame my friend;118
673;2023-05-27 23:19:00;2.0;You could try reading it on a ebook reader  that way you can just highlight the words you don t know with your finger and get the translation right away ;2021
674;2023-05-27 23:20:00;2.0;Download the kindle app  You can click on the word and get an immediate definition  Check out the books through the library and send them to the app  Totally free and under valued imho ;1978
675;2023-05-27 23:28:00;2.0;I ve read all my life and it still happens  We don t know all words and reading is learning them as we go  Plus Carl Sagan is not light reading  He s a scientist and uses language in an elevated but beautiful way  You are just fine  I hope you continue to find books you enjoy  r suggestmeabook is a great place to look ;973
676;2023-05-27 23:38:00;2.0;Being willing to learn and researching things you don t understand is the opposite of stupid ;1829
677;2023-05-27 23:42:00;2.0;grew up with the whole encyclopedia Britannica  anime  gaming  and comics from the 80s and 90s so by the age of twelve all those concepts and words were normal to me  D but thats prob a bit rare  try reading BWS weapon X when your 7   P;762
678;2023-05-27 23:44:00;2.0;I ve read hundreds of books and have quite a large vocabulary  but even now there are some books in which I need to look up a few words  Sometimes I will know a word but can t recall exactly what it means because I see it so rarely   Don t feel bad about this  and please don t think poorly of yourself  Vocabulary can always be improved  whichever rung of the ladder you might happen to start on  Reading will help immensely   Also  the book you are reading is from the 60s 70s  which means it will contain some words that have fallen out of popular usage and some terms that are simply not in the public consciousness any more  The more science fiction you read  the more you will understand some of the more technical terms ;984
679;2023-05-27 23:46:00;2.0;Try reading on a Kindle  or using the Kindle app  You can look up many words while reading  from within the app ;1094
680;2023-05-28 00:05:00;2.0;If you ve never read a word how could you know what it means   You re not necessarily stupid  just ignorant when it comes to vocabulary ;1595
681;2023-05-28 00:06:00;2.0;Good for you  keep at it    when I encounter words I am unfamiliar with I add them to an alphabetical vocab list with a definition and I occasionally review the list;858
682;2023-05-28 00:06:00;2.0;you answered your question   You are not well read  This is how people learn   School only gives you so much and then pretty much leaves you on your own   Stupid would be to continue this  ignorance   Good luck ;1676
683;2023-05-28 00:15:00;2.0;The more you read  the more you will learn by inference in the context of which of the word you are puzzling about is written  I have a lot of trouble sometimes with Dickens  because words like  antimacassar  are no longer in use ;209
684;2023-05-28 00:40:00;2.0;Got to start reading sometime   And looking up word you don t know is the way to do it   Carl Sagan was a smart guy and he usually explained things in ways anyone can understand   Richard Feynman is like that too   The level of their vocabulary is what I found normal for their generation   Younger folks aren t required or encouraged to learn anymore  No student left behind  New math  etc ;777
685;2023-05-28 00:41:00;2.0;I just finished a star wars novel and decided I need to take a break from science fiction  All the made up species and the character and planet names are all mostly gibberish   Je isiwakjzj from the planet yziqowlke   I m like why do I do this to myself ;351
686;2023-05-28 01:03:00;2.0;Whipping out a dictionary while reading is how I learned most of my vocab   In fact  my mom told me she loves reading ebooks   one of the reasons is so she can look up words immediately inside the app   she loves that feature   Sounds like you re getting into the deep end of reading   Sagan is no joke  He s a great author but still plenty of scientific material to work through    If you re ok with the rhythm of picking up a dictionary to get through his stuff  then keep going  Sounds like an engaging book   If you re getting a bit frustrated  maybe take a break   or see if you can get it on audio and alternate audio chapters   You can always come back to a book you didn t finish   or reread a book you did finish    As long as you re having fun with your reading   keep going    ;2205
687;2023-05-28 01:20:00;2.0;I use my iPhone to read books  it lets you just highlight words you don t know and show definitions pretty quickly;2249
688;2023-05-28 01:36:00;2.0;This is a thing all the way up  The better you get at reading the more you level up   you re always having to look up words  At my best ten years ago  I was having to look up Greek and Latin terms because I was reading Umberto Eco  I m way out of practice  I can t read that well at all any more but I still remember my vocabulary  I m excited for you  Level up ;1709
689;2023-05-28 01:37:00;2.0;That happens to me all the time  Don t worry about that  I have been an avid reader since childhood and there are always words I don t know  You can look them up or just try to feel how they add to the general meaning  Keep reading now that you have re  discovered it ;1561
690;2023-05-28 01:38:00;2.0;I don t know about kindle  but on my kobo you can just long press a word and it brings up the definition for you  Game changing ;664
691;2023-05-28 01:43:00;2.0;You re not stupid  I m a librarian and lifelong reader still learning new words often   sometimes lots of words and other times maybe one  depends on what I m reading  The average American reads at a 7th 8th grade level ;631
692;2023-05-28 01:46:00;2.0;Stupid people who are curious don t stay stupid ;264
693;2023-05-28 01:56:00;2.0;You can try reading it on an iPad  One of the best things about the ebooks app is that you can touch a word and there s an option to show a dictionary definition of it  Having that ability will keep you moving along in the book and disrupt your reading less    Btw  demon haunted world is a wonderful book but also can get very dry at some point so kudos to you for persisting ;1417
694;2023-05-28 02:15:00;2.0;The nice thing about reading books like this on an Ereader  like a Kindle  is you can go directly to an online dictionary  This works well when reading about a subject you know little about or references music and art  Click on the word and go to the dictionary  Wikipedia or similar website   Edit  I read a lot  Right now I m reading the Covenant of Water and I m unfamiliar with Indian words  customs  flora  medical terminology and this technique makes it so much easier to understand ;866
695;2023-05-28 02:22:00;2.0;All readers do this but less and less the more you read  Sure  it s a bit frustrating  but it was worth it for me ;1751
696;2023-05-28 02:52:00;2.0;As others have said  reading will increase your vocabulary  If you have the cash  consider investing in a Kindle  When reading  you can tap and hold on a word and it will define it for you  I m 45  read around 2 books per week  and mix it up with easy and difficult books  I still use this feature from time to time ;2071
697;2023-05-28 02:54:00;2.0;AAAand that my friend is why you read  in addition to have nice movie by yourself in you head  Education and expand vocabulary    And on future read  let context guide you  ignore words you don t understand  they will pop up again and eventually make sense without looking it up to avoid breaks and keep flow      Welcome to another world ;458
698;2023-05-28 02:56:00;2.0;If you read with a Kindle you can highlight words and get a definition for them fairly easily;1783
699;2023-05-28 03:11:00;2.0;bruh your vernacular is weak af;848
700;2023-05-28 03:11:00;2.0;u imGoingToEatYourTots I highly recommend doing the ebook version  You can long press any word on kindle or google books to have the word definition pop up for you  I do this for particularly dense books when I don t understand something and it is a life savers for keeping the pace of the book going while still understanding the topics ;2336
701;2023-05-28 03:23:00;2.0;Reading is a skill like any other skill  You will develop your skill at reading the more you are exposed to these things    You re doing great and having to look up words is not a hindrance but a benefit to you  You are expanding your reading skills  exercising your brain  and exposing yourself to new concepts and culture    Keep it up ;1209
702;2023-05-28 03:32:00;2.0;People can usually figure out what the word mean from the context it is used in   So if you can t figure it out from the context and find yourself in this situation often  then it most likely your vocabulary is lacking ;2044
703;2023-05-28 03:33:00;2.0;The kindle  or kindle app  is great for this  because you can just tap on the word and the definition pops up ;1618
704;2023-05-28 03:35:00;2.0;You only have to learn each new word once  I m always excited when I encounter a word unknown to me  as it means I get to add something to my vocabulary   Be thankful you have access to the sum total of human knowledge at your fingertips ;125
705;2023-05-28 03:44:00;2.0;Literally the way people build vocabulary is by reading   You re not stupid  you re  learning ;2393
706;2023-05-28 03:46:00;2.0;You re not stupid  you just haven t been reading  so you never developed a large vocabulary  Then you started with Carl Sagan  so the learning curve is going to be steep lol   Just keep reading and you will add lots of vocabulary  And learn lots of other things by learning the vocabulary as well ;608
707;2023-05-28 03:47:00;2.0;This seems totally normal to me  Most of the words I know that aren t common conversation words  I know from reading  The more you read the easier it will be  Definitely recommend ebooks for this reason   most e readers  Kindle  iPad  Google etc  will let you just tap a word and look up the definition  It s nice to not have to go back and forth between the book and Google ;984
708;2023-05-28 03:47:00;2.0;Needing a dictionary while you read books above your regular reading level is normal  The best way to grow your vocabulary imo ;2265
709;2023-05-28 03:52:00;2.0;So   this is totally a thing if you re reading anything medical related  or anything with specific jargon involved   so I wouldn t sweat it too much    That being said though  yup  That s how it works   you ll get a great big vocabulary of you keep it up though ;1467
710;2023-05-28 03:52:00;2.0;This is what they taught us in law school  Every time there is a word you don t understand look it up  or honestly google it   Once you understand it in the sentence move on  It will take some time at first  but before you know it  You ll be cruising through the books ;690
711;2023-05-28 03:52:00;2.0;When I started reading books with lots of unfamiliar words in them  at the age of 16  after a knee surgery  I had to keep a dictionary nearby  now all you need to do is look it up in your phone  This is the path to a larger lexicon ;1198
712;2023-05-28 03:53:00;2.0;I ve read hundreds of books and still find words that I  have to Google;2373
713;2023-05-28 04:05:00;2.0;If you read on a Kindle or similar E reader  even on your phone  you are able to just select a word and have it pull the definition for you    Hope that helps;1016
714;2023-05-28 04:06:00;2.0;Your vocabulary is limited because  as you note  you ve read so little  But watch it expand now  Some authors are worse than others for that  of course  in fantasy  for instance  Stephen R  Donaldson comes to mind as a writer who uses incredibly obscure words on every page  and Gene Wolfe and Frank Herbert have milder but similar tendencies  a few Donaldson words  Chlamys  Chary  Catenulated  Condign  Fug  Stridulation  Percipience  Fetor  Surquedry  Cymar  Jerrid  Extirpate  Telic   ;1327
715;2023-05-28 04:06:00;2.0;I read a lot and still pull out my phone to look stuff up often  Nothing wrong with not knowing ;1914
716;2023-05-28 04:06:00;2.0;Well  you re reading something written by a scholar  so it s okay if you re unfamiliar with some words  The one thing I would VERY much suggest is having a notebook to write those words down  and when you search up the definition  write them down  Creating a  Personal Dictionary  will help you acquire and maintain a knowledge of the words  Eventually you ll be able to add them to your vocabulary  It will make reading a lot slower  but the more you acquire  the more you ll understand when reading other texts ;1899
717;2023-05-28 04:12:00;2.0;I have read thousands of books and have an exceptional vocabulary  but I still have to look words up  especially when I m reading something scientific  Sometimes you ll have to look up the same word multiple times because it means something different in a different context  You are expanding your mind and that is awesome  Soon you won t have to look up as many words and it will feel more natural  Keep it up ;1563
718;2023-05-28 04:33:00;2.0;I m a little concerned that you don t know what syphilis is ;1679
719;2023-05-28 04:34:00;2.0;Keep it up  You re learning new words and with that comes new ways to express yourself and articulate your feelings  It ll get better  You are not stupid so don t even worry;2048
720;2023-05-28 04:35:00;2.0;I had an English teacher once who d make us all go around the room reading passages from what we were assigned to read the night before  When an unusual word came up he d ask the class what does that word mean  What does that word mean   And then he d say if you don t stop and look up every word you come across that you don t know  then you re not really reading   And I think we all agreed with the logic yet no one would ever actually look up any words though we knew his line of questioning would follow the next day and the next    Point is your current vocabulary is far less important than your ability and willingness to learn and I know how much discipline it takes to whip your phone out every time to look something up;1362
721;2023-05-28 04:36:00;2.0;If you never learned a word  you shouldn t expect yourself to know its definition    A lot of people have mentioned using a dictionary to figure out words  which I agree with  but I wanted to suggest something that helps me a lot  Latin and greek roots   So many words use Latin roots as a building block  and you probably already know a few Latin prefixes suffixes already  whether you learned them in school or not   Pre  means before  like in  prepare  or  prefix    Re  means again or backwards  like in  repeat  or  restock    My favorite root to demonstrate this point with is  inter    Inter  means between  The internet allows communication between computers  An interstate highway is a highway between at least two states  In the movie Interstellar  the astronauts travel between solar systems   Learning some of these building blocks of English words  as well as context clues  can be a huge boost for your vocabulary ;30
722;2023-05-28 04:36:00;2.0;I m reading  The Demon Haunted World  right now too  Im glad you re enjoying it as much as I am  I m a pretty avid reader but I have some words I m looking up as well  Definitely as you read more  the less you ll look up as time goes on    One of my favorite quotes so far   The nitrogen in our DNA  the calcium in our teeth  the iron in our blood  the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars  We are made of starstuff   Reading that made me realize how connected we are   ;81
723;2023-05-28 04:43:00;2.0;I m fiftyish  read a lot my entire life  and I  still  look up words   You hit a goldmine of specialised medical scientific words and somewhat old fashioned words all in the one book   But I bet it s fascinating   I would have come across those words over time in a range of murder mysteries  from Sherlock Holmes to Agatha Christie to modern forensic focussed TV mysteries and paperback thrillers   Thalidomide s use as an anti nausea drug without anyone knowing of the birth defect consequences is such a sad thing  I first read about it in an article  not a book     Every profession  job has its own range of technical vocabulary  whether it s scientists  carpenters  plumbers  electricians  dressmakers  fashion designers  architects or geologists   The rest of us are going to be looking up words when we read stories or articles involving them     As I get older I have gotten excited that there will never ever be nothing new to see or learn   Just being on reddit I still get to see pictures or video of extraordinary birds and plants I have never seen in my entire life before   Being subscribed to r space and r astronomy and r askscience is a marvel     The universe and life on Earth is  so cool  ;1632
724;2023-05-28 04:49:00;2.0;Reading TDHW    REALLY AWESOME   you re doing that  it s an   excellent   book   Yep  Sagan would write for a more well read audience most of the time so I m not surprised you re having some trouble with the word choices  He d  absolutely love  the fact that you re looking up the words  though  This is   exactly   the kind of personal education he spent his life  talking about to millions  He was a genius  but a loveable one   I ve read this a few times and would be only too happy to help you out with any of it if you want to DM me  I m a physics teacher with a masters in physics  too ;1226
725;2023-05-28 04:50:00;2.0;For maybe the future   If you got a kindle paperwhite  with ebooks you can select a word and it can give you the definition;985
726;2023-05-28 04:53:00;2.0;You re not dumb  just inexperienced  Keep reading and you ll get better  like any skill ;1328
727;2023-05-28 04:53:00;2.0;I m a teacher   Once you learn how to read  the main difference between a good reader and a non so good reader is vocabulary     The number one place to pick up vocabulary is through reading   Reading often and reading widely   People just don t use a huge bank of words in every day speech     If you read for about an hour a day and are at your stage of reading  you ll learn a couple thousand words a year   It s incredible what your brain will absorb   Keep reading anything you enjoy   Hats off to you  you ve inspired me to add a book to my  to be read  list ;1316
728;2023-05-28 05:26:00;2.0;Buy a dictionary and expand your mind  It s great to learn and new words a especially fun  The risk of becoming sesquipedalian is very low ;959
729;2023-05-28 06:10:00;2.0;What you re doing is a term called clearing  When you don t know a word and can t figure it out from context clues  you stop  and learn    Your vocabulary will grow very quickly  You got this ;1509
730;2023-05-28 06:22:00;2.0;Keep reading  and you will begin develop a sense for remembering words in their context  It is natural to not know too many words  but then subconsciously we keep absorbing  The only criteria is  keep reading and learning;35
731;2023-05-28 07:03:00;2.0;They say first you learn to read then you read to learn  Everyone starts somewhere ;2411
732;2023-05-28 07:06:00;2.0;If it is any consolation  while my lifelong love of reading allows me to know a lot of words and their meanings  I only have about a 20  success rate on proper pronunciation and have learned the hard way  multiple times  often in group settings that my internal voice is not very eloquent     Referencing a dictionary is the skill of a well read person in my opinion  Language is generational as well  so you re more likely to run into certain types or words in certain eras more so than in others and they re often out of use for a reason  Don t be afraid to confront what you don t know     On a light hearted note  there s a great scene in Where The Heart Is  where Natalie Portman s middle school  dropout character is trying to educate herself  but she has to use a standard dictionary to define the words she doesn t know  and then a child s dictionary to define the words within the definition she doesn t know  She has a great rant about how much of a pain in the butt it is and how it take forever to read anything     Over time though  you ll get better at picking up context clues within the surrounding sentences  and recognizing root meanings in unfamiliar words  You might not know exactly what the word means but you ll have enough context to guess the general idea until you can look it up    Having something you like to read is half the battle  so take your time and enjoy the journey  Douglas Adams might be an enjoyable follow up if you re taking recommendations  Good luck ;1384
733;2023-05-28 07:23:00;2.0; So every paragraph  I have to whip out my phone and quickly look up the definition to a word    This is fucking awesome  You re in the 1 or 2  of people who will actually do this  and it means that you re   the opposite   of stupid    Also  the more you do this  the less you ll have to do this  Seriously  congrats on this behavior  You re building good habits and training yourself to constantly improve ;429
734;2023-05-28 07:42:00;2.0;I used to read a lot  English was one of my favorite subjects in school  Life has been busy  so reading has been put on the back burner  When I do find the time though  I ll occasionally pick up a book that has me looking up words  shoot  sometimes entire ideas to gain a better understanding of the context behind a scenario  No one knows everything  Taking the time to learn means you re definitely not stupid   ;1890
735;2023-05-28 07:49:00;2.0;It s called a reading level  It doesn t mean your stupid  Just that you don t read very much    When you mostly read current works or online  Your not reading much vocabulary  The older the book the more complicated the words  Think of Shakespeare    It s up to you if you want to expand this knowledge ;96
736;2023-05-28 07:50:00;2.0;This is how you learn things and develop vocabulary  You read things that challenge you  I ve read many more books than you have and because of this I wouldn t have to look up the words in your OP  but at one time I didn t know them and I did need to look up them ;582
737;2023-05-27 20:18:00;2.0;i learned half of my vocabulary by looking up the words in a dictionary or googling them  i found all of those words reading books and fanfiction  Don t feel bad about not knowing words  there are literally thousands of them  and that is only the English language ;1989
738;2023-05-27 17:16:00;2.0;I read a decent amount and I had trouble reading brave new world a couple of years ago  Some books are just a bit harder to read but it expands your vocabulary a lot  And at least it s easy to pull out your phone to check a word  I remember reading Frankenstein in high school and needing a dictionary lol;1846
739;2023-05-28 02:36:00;2.0;You should check out books by the author Mary Roach  She dives into the science of certain topics in each book but makes it accessible for the general public ;1457
740;2023-05-27 23:53:00;2.0;Switch to a kindle  You can highlight any word and it ll give you the definition there and then;1838
741;2023-05-27 20:14:00;2.0;Not a bad thing at all  Some authors are just very frilly and wordy  tho  So it might not be you  Either way  learning new words is one of the best things that can come out of reading;982
742;2023-05-28 11:51:00;2.0;Get the kindle app and use its dictionary to read ;629
743;2023-05-28 01:17:00;2.0;Learning new vocab is like learning the streets in the new neighborhood you just moved to  Repetition will build recognition ;180
744;2023-05-28 02:43:00;2.0;Don t be so hard on yourself  Some people just watch TV all the time and have never read book  At least you ve read 5  Keep going  If you don t understand a word just look it up    You re not stupid  You re trying  I like that you re aiming high with Carl Sagan ;64
745;2023-05-28 03:00:00;2.0;Ideally  you ll usually want to be reading one grade above your current reading level  I was told that if you don t know 1 2 words per page  then that s a good place to be  5 6 per page is a little high  And once per paragraph is definitely a big leap    When I read  I write down every word I don t know in a small notebook and later look up the definitions all at once    If you take a pen and paper  define a word  and use it in three different sentences  then you ll have downloaded it in your mental lexicon forever  Drills like that have helped me a lot    I would suggest trying something a bit more accessible  by the same author if possible  Another thing you ll come to realize is that each writer has their own  language  so to speak  And the more you get a feel for how they communicate  the easier it will be to discern what they are saying ;1343
746;2023-05-28 04:57:00;2.0;I remember the first time I read A Song of Ice and Fire when I was 17  and I had to CONSTANTLY check the definitions of old terms  Fortunately I read on my phone using Google Play books  so all you have to do is hold down on the word and it brings up the definition ;489
747;2023-05-28 02:04:00;2.0;This is ok my dude  You ll only get better with time  Just look up each word as you go  boring to start with but it gets easier  And read as much as you can ;1755
748;2023-05-27 16:20:00;2.0;We re supposed to keep reaching for the dictionary   my English teacher said so   Later in your life you find out exactly what a word means meant  e g  candid means white  I think   I d better look it up to make sure   Bless your heart  you re too young to have lived through the thalidomide babies being born ;1570
749;2023-05-28 01:46:00;2.0;Yeah  The gist of it is that you are indeed  as you put it   stupid   But that s OK  How do you expect to have a versatile vocabulary that comes with the experience of reading many books without having read many books   Just have patience and keep searching up the meaning of unknown words and you ll be fine ;1073
750;2023-05-27 16:21:00;2.0;read with a dictionary handy  we did it in high school before the inrwenet ;1408
751;2023-05-27 15:59:00;2.0;If you intend to continue reading  which you should   eReaders generally have built in dictionaries where you can just long press a word   Also  I have a decent vocabulary but you ll always run up against new words eventually  Writers can be cheeky in their use of uncommon verbiage   AND there is no shame in looking stuff up  It s actually an excellent way to learn new things  You re not on a timer or anything ;2297
752;2023-05-27 18:27:00;2.0;The more you read  the better you gonna be with vocabulary    it s not something surprising for readers but I understand why you are wondering if it is normal  Keep going   ;1366
753;2023-05-27 17:24:00;1998.0;Plus  it sounds like you re reading material that it s largely unfamiliar to you  not to mention a much more  dense  read     Zero reason to feel any apprehension about having to stop to look up words or content  I read things often that lead me to a dictionary  or down a wikihole   Your post doesn t tell me you re stupid  or less intelligent to the contrary  or tells me that you re curious  eager to learn  and unafraid   Like others have said here  keep at it  You ll incidentally build your vocabulary  and depending on the material you read  you ll become better at articulating your own ideas and you ll add to your conversational Arsenal    Stay curious   ;1290
754;2023-05-27 17:15:00;397.0;I have a pretty good vocabulary  There are two big reasons  1  reading is a major hobby for me  even if what I read is mostly brain candy  authors will still use words like megalomaniac or saccharine  2  My dad used to make me do words of the week when I was a kid  Defining seven words and using them in sentences  It helped with the SAT lol;2387
755;2023-05-27 17:48:00;11.0;This   Also  I love that you ve kept a list    Some of those are words I looked up when I was getting into reading as a teen  When I read your note Thalidomide literally took me back to reading old readers digest back issues on holidays at my grandparents     It ll get easier ;2192
756;2023-05-27 17:57:00;6.0;I remember taking this for granted growing up  I read so much that I didn t have a good grasp of what words people were likely and unlikely to know  I still don t always if I m being honest  and I would get comments on my vocabulary all the time    Some people get weirdly annoyed with you if  in conversation  you use words that they don t know  It s like they think you re being pretentious or trying to make them look bad ;862
757;2023-05-27 17:01:00;49.0;On top of that  some authors are more advanced and or particularly specific with what they re trying to say  so you may need to look up stuff more often for some than others  Carl Sagan was a science professor and released this book in the 90s  so his writing is likely more advanced but also somewhat dated compared to today ;550
758;2023-05-27 19:11:00;3.0;As a reading teacher  this is exactly how you learn  If it is too frustrating  you can start with some easier to ingest books and save Carl for next year when you ve read more and have built up your vocabulary  It will probably be more enjoyable   ;2240
759;2023-05-28 00:53:00;6.0;I grew up reading Calvin and Hobbes comics  Now I go back and look at them and realize it was at a very adult reading level sometimes  Calvin s vocabulary is crazy;1586
760;2023-05-27 20:05:00;2.0;This bit also  dont be shy to use a good old fasshioned google search  i have had whole meanings of books changed based off of jy misintepretation of a key words meaning ;2333
761;2023-05-27 22:56:00;2.0;I hope I am doing this correctly  For OP if you use digital e books there are usually dictionary features that can quickly help you learn new words as you read without having to leave the page and Google something  Good luck ;970
762;2023-05-27 20:17:00;2.0; I read a lot as a child and I learned what a lot of words mean based on context  but there are so many words that I still mispronounce in my head when I read because I only read them and didn t hear anyone say them out loud until later in life ;1920
763;2023-05-27 19:02:00;46.0;Keep preserving  I mean  I guess the kid can read AND can peaches in their spare time   Edited to add  previous post was edited to correct spelling mistake  ;1304
764;2023-05-28 03:24:00;218.0;When I really started getting into reading 18  yrs ago  I had a similar experience then realized that I actually knew a majority of the words  I just had never or very infrequently seen the words in type ;1180
765;2023-05-27 18:26:00;2.0;    the only thing I m unfamiliar with in that list is thalidomide  but I can tell it s some kind of chemical or medication  maybe  Still agree with your assessment  tho ;329

767;2023-05-27 19:44:00;369.0;Library e books often have the same feature  If your library uses the Libby app you can highlight a word and get a link to a definition  Wikipedia   ;2039
768;2023-05-28 00:10:00;71.0;I was an avid book worm growing up  I was that kid reading at recess and lunch  I kept a dictionary in my backpack and looked up every word I didn t know   That  is  why  I know all the words now       I still look up words all the time  I just ask Google now instead or use my phone ;325
769;2023-05-27 19:08:00;19.0;I use that feature regularly   A lot of times  I can figure out the word from context  but it s nice to know the full definition ;1674
770;2023-05-27 18:26:00;57.0;This has been really helpful for me reading  Dracula   Same vibe  it was pulpy easy reading a long time ago but now these words aren t commonly used  It s nice being able to hold down a word and learn it means a  dog led cart  or  village that no longer exists because the ground subsided   etc   Instead of having to guess from context   OP  I read  The Demon Haunted World  and Science as a Candle in the Dark as audiobooks  They re actually read by carl Sagan  New words are much easier to understand when spoken by someone who gets it  Same way  Shakespeare can be understood when the speaker gets it   https   youtube com watch v q6CLdCl9TB0 feature share8  So  that s an option if it keeps feeling like a struggle ;1204
771;2023-05-28 00:19:00;51.0;I love use that Kindle feature so much that sometimes when reading physical books I find myself  without thinking  attempting to hold down a word to see the definition;251
772;2023-05-28 04:44:00;8.0;They also have word wise  which will add helpful word hints or context directly on page in margins so you don t have to tap  with the option to scale up or down how much information you want ;314
773;2023-05-28 04:12:00;20.0;I was going to recommend a Kindle for this  too  This feature is super helpful ;902
774;2023-05-27 22:25:00;2.0;Agree  If sometimes you get sick of your phone an old school pocket dictionary is nice   Vocabulary cards like Word Teasers can be fun if friends or family would enjoy making a game of it ;1560
775;2023-05-28 02:56:00;2.0;Google Play Books has the same;1764
776;2023-05-27 20:54:00;28.0;Seconded  And as an added benefit  your scrabble game is about to improve by leaps and bounds ;1066
777;2023-05-27 20:57:00;61.0;That s not the question  The question is  Is it normal to be 25 and have such a small vocabulary that 5 words per page are a mystery  ;395
778;2023-05-27 23:29:00;5.0;I m so used to it  I tried tapping on words on physical books;654
779;2023-05-28 06:17:00;19.0; the ability to just tap on a word to look up its definition  I love it but I do miss a good dictionary  As a kid I would randomly read pages and sure I didn t retain a lot of it but it was fun ;1695
780;2023-05-27 20:23:00;2.0;Would you agree that this is fun but within reason  Like  obviously this is how one grows their vocabulary but when it s a dozen a chapter or every few sentences I think you gotta take it a step down and keep building  I guess I m only thinking in academics it s why I m asking you if I m wrong on thinking that way ;713
781;2023-05-27 23:29:00;48.0;Exactly  Some of the terms  like folly and thalidomide  are a bit more dated  You re not going to see them in everyday speech  And something like syphilis is something people learn about in pretty specific situations or cultural moments  Not everybody is going to have a decent sex ed curriculum or medical knowledge  or spend a lot of time googling Al Capone   Any familiarity people have with words is because they re exposed to new things at some point and pay enough attention to take them in  or because they hear them all the time and understand the context of how to use them  even without knowing the literal meaning  sometimes   Wanting to understand what the things you read actually mean is the opposite of stupidity ;701
782;2023-05-27 22:40:00;13.0;  thalidomide  Three women are knitting for their soon to be born child  The first mother digs into her purse pops a pill and says   That was some Vitamin A  and my child will grow up to be big and strong   The second woman also reaches into her purse   swallows a pill and exclaims   That was Vitamin C  and my child will grow up to be incredibly smart   The third woman pops her pill and says   That was Thalidomide  I can t the get arms right on this fucking sweater  ;630
783;2023-05-28 12:06:00;5.0;It s a really great book  and fortunately for me  I found it a pretty easy read  but I have a decent reading vocabulary although my pronunciation is not great for words that I ve never heard spoken  Congratulations on reading a challenging book  I notice certain messageboards are rife with people with enormous vocabularies and I find myself looking up a lot of words  but that is pretty easy when online   I was born in the era of thalidomide deformities  so I m well aware of it  Interesting enough  it was approved in the United States in 1998 for use as a treatment for cancer  It is on the World Health Organization s List of Essential Medicines  Just don t take it if you are pregnant ;1518
784;2023-05-27 23:23:00;2.0;Someone may even know about syphilis but only ever have heard slang words for it ;390
785;2023-05-27 23:30:00;72.0;Thalidomide was an anti nausea medication prescribed to pregnant women back in the day  It resulted in a lot of children being born without properly developed limbs   One particularly well known example from my country is Brian Gault  I had the pleasure of hearing him read his biography   look  no hands   he s a real showman ;1817
786;2023-05-28 02:27:00;44.0;Thalidomide is a medication that caused some pretty horrific birth defects back in the 50s  so it s a word not many people would know unless they ve studied medicine  I only know it because I took a pharmacology class for my degree;952
787;2023-05-27 23:20:00;3.0;Science and medicine  some other fields  tend to use Greek and or Latin  Latinized and Latin derived terms or names for things  Even people s names;19
788;2023-05-27 18:29:00;12.0;Yeah legit  All fine except you should definitely know what syphilis is if you are sexually active or ever intend to be  Regular STI screening is very important  Between every sexual partner  or every 3 6 months ;1145
789;2023-05-27 16:59:00;32.0;While you re right  I m more concerned about  chiefly   Who  over the age of 10  hasn t seen the word  chief  in  any  context  Who over the age of 20 doesn t know what the  c  in CEO  CFO  or CoS stands for  No sports teams  no basic business terms  no American history knowledge at all  That one worries me a bit ;745
790;2023-05-27 23:24:00;4.0;Then they get loose and a beat cop finds you creeping around an alley  and asks what you re doing    I m looking for syphilis  officer   Reminds me of a guilty pleasure movie   Hudson Hawk    Do you know what it s like being called Chlamydia for a year  ;52
791;2023-05-27 22:36:00;23.0;Ya the fact that someone could get through at least 12 years of school and only have read 5 books is horrifying  Not a dig at this person  it s completely not their fault that the school system failed them   A really sad thing I remember about literacy statistics in the US is that not only are 20  of US adults functionally illiterate  but the majority of the people that are aren t even aware of it  Like when asked they self reported as thinking that they had average reading comprehension skills  Makes sense if you never really try and read anything complicated you wouldn t notice how much you don t understand ;1629
792;2023-05-27 23:58:00;5.0;Or if you don t want to commit to buying an eReader amazing does just have a kindle app for your phone  Works fairly well aside from some annoying bugs that have popped up recently ;2263
793;2023-05-27 20:54:00;37.0;Cannot help but laugh at the syphilis part;59
794;2023-05-28 05:01:00;19.0;Both can be true;152
795;2023-05-28 04:15:00;27.0;I can t believe the number of comments being dishonest with OP and suggesting this is normal if you don t read a lot  I started learning English as a teenager and can t say I ve read many books in English since  but OP s examples all seem to be common and fairly basic words to me  with the exception of thalidomide  which I came across for the first time on r Documentaries a few days ago   Even if they don t read  OP should have encountered these words in conversation  TV  public speeches  etc  Syphilis in particular is baffling ;391
796;2023-05-27 19:45:00;24.0;I am so not a history person but I can surprise people by whipping out some historic fact and they are all like  how do you know that        And I m like well in this book about vampires that I was reading they talked about this event that happened that is a fictional account of the real world thing that happened  So I wanted to know more about it and so I went online and researched it   They kind of look at me and are like  so vampires    And I m like  were at the Alamo   Yes  in my book they were ;1747
797;2023-05-27 22:13:00;13.0;It s pretty generous to determine they re not stupid  I feel like we can t say definitively and a lot of things point to either stupid or insanely undereducated;239
798;2023-05-27 22:47:00;17.0; You re not stupid  If they work in a drs office and don t know what syphilis is  then they are stupid  Lol;31
799;2023-05-28 02:13:00;4.0;Yeah  I was a bit surprised when I saw the list of examples  I wonder if when encountering them in an audio form  you get from context and inflection what it means  and maybe gloss over it without really learning the words ;659
800;2023-05-28 03:06:00;33.0;I have to agree with this  I m trying really hard not to judge OP but if I m being honest  I would assume they are pretty simple if they don t know these words   ;358
801;2023-05-27 19:14:00;14.0;You can learn words conversationally or through film tv etc ;502
802;2023-05-27 19:52:00;17.0;With the exception of thalidomide I agree  It s not a troll  I know plenty of people with as poor of a vocabulary;1895
803;2023-05-27 18:59:00;32.0;Right  The fact OP doesn t know these words honestly baffles me  These aren t even unusual words by any standard aside from maybe the drug one  If you don t know these words not only is your vocabulary very very poor  but your general knowledge is severely lacking as well ;2231
804;2023-05-27 19:47:00;3.0;I love being able to do that  On the one I use  I just press the word with my finger and it ll bring up a dictionary entry or Wikipedia link  It s very helpful when reading books from other times or cultures  I m reading John Cleese s autobiography right now and there is the occasional word that I don t know or don t have cultural context for  Tranmere Rovers  potholing  Lilo  Gitanes  charabanc  houseman  philology  funked it  snaffling  The ease of looking up these words in the app has even translated to looking up words when reading paper books  it s encouraged a good habit ;989
805;2023-05-27 22:12:00;2.0;If you can read and take in all these comments you will be able to finish any book;1496
806;2023-05-27 22:45:00;435.0;Most e readers now connect to the internet  and have this excellent and useful feature where you can tap on words to pull up their definition  Very useful  and might make that a smoother process for you  Keep it up    ;1899
807;2023-05-28 06:54:00;143.0;Exactly  Everyone is welcome to the world of reading   The entry fee is the tenacity to keep going despite not knowing all the vocabulary     Sagan is a great place to start because so many people are interested in science but it can be technical and dry reading   He also wrote a lovely book that became a film  Contact that you may be interested in ;13
808;2023-05-27 21:01:00;60.0;This is the answer OP  I grew up reading a lot  I kept a dictionary next to me  Nowadays you can use a kindle or tablet and look up words on there  But just keep reading and your vocabulary will expand readily ;1209

858;2023-05-27 19:35:00;5.0;Maybe so  but I m also not in the habit of assuming stupidity just because they don t know a ton of words  But the  one   thing we know of them  that they are looking up words and not letting their lack of a vocabulary keep them from reading  smacks of intelligence  Like I said in my first comment  there s plenty of people who would just stew in their ignorance for the rest of their life  and eventually get duped by some bro on YouTube that it s everyone else s fault for making them feel stupid  OP s working on themselves  and that s worth pointing out and celebrating ;474
859;2023-05-27 19:48:00;3.0;   oh  I m going to have to agree with that  That s just BAD ;658

866;2023-05-28 02:17:00;4.0;Another option is reading some material with simpler vocabulary first  Generally anything aimed at Young adults is going to be more sparing than stuff like Sagan or really anything technical ;2258
867;2023-05-28 03:00:00;9.0;Possibly the one time I think the movie is better than the book   The movie adds a sense of wonder and awe that is just missing in the book   But the book had a more elegant ending   Although one that was kind of shocking given Sagan s famously athiest stance ;1284
868;2023-05-28 07:05:00;9.0;I used to do that too  And sometimes my dictionary wasn t good enough and I had to go hunt down the big one ;714

877;2023-05-27 22:36:00;16.0;I still  to this day  as a somewhat old person  find myself using words I ve never said out loud  and questioning whether I m pronouncing them correctly  It s fun  though  to pull one out of your mental dictionary and give them a try  mispronounced or not    ;1880
878;2023-05-28 11:23:00;36.0;I only recently realized biopic was bio pic  I ve been pronouncing it like biOPic because that s the stress for most words ending in  opic   Like helioTROPic ;77

882;2023-05-27 19:38:00;2.0;My husband   I were talking about this  He s been an avid reader his whole life unlike me  He said definitely not stupid for not knowing  That s how you learn  exposing yourself to things you didn t know    I like to say that you don t know what you don t know because you haven t learned it yet ;900

884;2023-05-28 01:07:00;2.0;I had this happen  too  I had a high reading level at a young age and came across so many words that I knew the meaning of and how to spell but not how to pronounce  Like annihilate  I thought it was pronounced  Ann ih hill late  not  uh nai yuh late    Also I thought the words segue and the spoken word Seg wei  were two different words  I didn t realize they were pronounced the same  I was pronouncing  it  see guh   I still have to remind myself   It s also really funny because on Reddit most users spell segue as  segway   even though a Segway is a brand name only and only refers to the motorized vehicle ;1812
885;2023-05-27 22:13:00;16.0;I used to skip over words like that  Understood them by context  but wasn t sure the exact meaning  Now with my Nook I started looking them up instead  With some interesting results ;947

904;2023-05-27 19:48:00;13.0;Yeah I just meant that it s a niche word so no need to feel embarrassed or unintelligent for not knowing it because it s not a word many people would know unless they ve came across it in some context;1440

933;2023-05-27 21:39:00;14.0;Just to be clear  you can check out a library book on libby and it ll sync on your kindle  I switched to kobo bc my kindle had a couple extra steps  but I guess it s improved ;2132

935;2023-05-28 00:28:00;6.0;Same here lol  There is just so much fascinating content in an encyclopedia for a curious young mind  I remember just reading for hours about the most random stuff    Childhood memory unlocked  my sister had trouble reading  and used hooked on phonics to catch up  I remember reading every one of the little story books that came with the whole set  They obviously got more and more complex as you read them  but it was also full of random interesting stories  I remember the very last one was about Einstein ;590

945;2023-05-27 21:40:00;77.0;Haha I still remember learning that  awry  is pronounced  a rye  when I was almost 30 years old and having already read thousands of books  I always love those discoveries ;1209
946;2023-05-27 23:27:00;9.0;this brought me back to a year 6 reading aloud assessment when i failed  lost all my lives didn t get down to the end of the page  because of the world colonel;636
947;2023-05-28 01:09:00;2.0;Well  actually  Colonel IS pronounced Koh Loh Nell      in French ;973

951;2023-05-28 02:43:00;7.0;Being French  i m not at all fazed by the complicated words of French origin  It s a huge advantage  Sometimes Shakespeare s lines sound easier than your everyday language ;861
952;2023-05-27 20:53:00;2.0;I still sometimes read it as  Kwinowa  even though I ve known how to pronounce it for years lol  I just struggle to connect the word the spelling;1752
953;2023-05-27 20:49:00;21.0;when I was in 4th grade I think  we had to read aloud for the principal for our reading test and I mispronounced both  licorice  and  Penelope  and they are 2 words that have haunted me for the last 37 years  I will never forget  ;1679
954;2023-05-28 04:23:00;21.0;I remember going through a Peanuts book and  correcting  all the  Beethovens  to  Batehoven  because I thought they were spelled wrong for the pronunciation  I was 6  I think  Then I learned  Beethoven  is correct because  it isn t in English    After some thought  I have to ask how you re reading books  Are you reading them as e books  or the old  dead tree  editions  I have probably the better part of a metric tonne of paper books  but my eyes aren t what they once were  so e books are preferable because I can change font and font size  Nearly all my reading now is either Kindle or Epub  Kindle is changing over to epub  which is good   The Kindle app will look up words for you if necessary  Just hold a finger on a word and the definition will pop up  There may be a setting for this  I forget  I believe the Epub reader I use  ReadEra  might have something similar I ll check and see  I m afraid I can t address what Apple does  I m not part of their reality distortion field   I use the lookup feature in the Kindle app once in a while  It works well  It gives a dictionary definition  a translation if it s in a foreign language  and a Wikipedia window  Don t feel bad about it  we re all at the mercy of our variable world  We all run into words we don t know    If you do read dead trees  that just a little more involved  I ve read books with a dictionary at hand a lot of times  I like science fiction  which adds words like McDonald s adds sandwiches ;850
955;2023-05-28 00:37:00;2.0;Don t feel bad  I used to say Beet the Oven  until my older sister  by 15 years  corrected me  I like my pronunciation better   ;365
956;2023-05-28 09:56:00;2.0;Haha we were reading from the play  Antigone  in middle school and I kept reading it as  anti gawn  not  Ann tih goh nee   I was so embarrassed when my teacher corrected me  ;354
957;2023-05-28 03:52:00;4.0;In your defense  the English pronunciation of  lingerie  makes even less sense than the rest of English pronunciation rules ;135
958;2023-05-27 23:08:00;4.0;We moved to a new town that had a shop called  Brasserie  in it  One weekend my parents announced they were taking me there  As a teenage boy I was freaking out that my parents were taking me to a bra shop and there was going to be some super awkward conversation about girls or something    It was a cafe  I am a huge word nerd but that day I learnt the subtle but important difference between Brasserie and Brassiere ;965
959;2023-05-27 23:23:00;3.0;I did the same thing   My friend was telling me where she got her lingerie for cheap and I was like wtf is longeray;432

965;2023-05-28 04:49:00;2.0;I was just thinking about it and I think the reason it s bio pic is because it s a noun  Your way sounds like an adjective ;1352
966;2023-05-28 04:12:00;6.0; also bio pic  1951  a contraction of biographical  moving  picture   These days the pronunciation difference falls more down UK US lines  but it did start out as  bio     pic ;250
967;2023-05-28 05:46:00;3.0;Hahaha   not quite the same but   we moved from California to Texas when my brother was about 2 and he stated saying  whuppin if  as in  what would happen if   Maybe it was an amalgamation of California and Texas accents on how he was hearing things at home versus out in the world ;1289
968;2023-05-28 06:11:00;16.0;I pick send to Kindle  or read with Kindle  or something similar  and it opens a browser to Amazon  and then I have to select which device  for no reason it becomes available on all my Kindle apps and devices   and then I can read it ;204
969;2023-05-28 06:47:00;5.0;For me  using Overdrive which I think may be the same as Libby  I click  checkout  select how many weeks I want it then click a button and it takes me to an Amazon page that sends it to my kindle    Very easy ;2105
970;2023-05-28 03:13:00;3.0;Yes but only in America I believe;941
971;2023-05-28 09:49:00;2.0;Yeah  do this all the time  In Libby you  send to Kindle   it syncs it to your Amazon  gets added to your library and then from Amazon you  deliver to Kindle   It s two steps instead of one  but I find it s not too bad cause Libby links out to Amazon  so you don t even really have to navigate search for the send to Kindle part ;1773
972;2023-05-27 22:29:00;10.0;That is because you are right and it is pulled by a pony    I am not sure where this person got dogs from   https   dictionary cambridge org dictionary english trap;1483
973;2023-05-28 12:36:00;3.0;Huh  I d never heard of KOReader and didnt know an alternative like that was available   What would I gain by installing it on my Kobo  Is there any risk of bricking my device by trying it ;487
974;2023-05-28 06:19:00;56.0;Ah yes  my mother has a story of her asking her insufferably superior and snooty french mother in law if she should bring some  whores devours  to the first dinner at their house  just after eloping with her precious son  ;2449
975;2023-05-28 01:04:00;37.0;As a lifelong avid reader and former proofreader for ad agencies it s been many years since I  M55  had one of those moments  But now my book input is 100  audiobooks  so I can multitask by reading while I m doing housework  driving  pacing anxiously for no good reason  etc  etc   and I sometimes catch a narrator flying past a funny mispronunciation where it s obvious they d never heard the word aloud before and apparently either the editor missed it or also didn t know the correct pronunciation  So that s fun ;1925
976;2023-05-27 21:20:00;13.0;And then you listen to an audio book series  and the narrator can t decide on how to pronounce  seax  between books      ;2059
977;2023-05-27 22:40:00;8.0;I still like to think that  misled   miss led  is pronounced  my zled  ;1486
978;2023-05-28 01:48:00;6.0;I remember talking to my parents about the atom bomb  I knew it was short for atomic and I had only seen it written so I pronounced it so it rhymed with bomb  Ah TOM bomb ;1788
979;2023-05-28 00:49:00;3.0;I did the same with  awry  even though I m an avid reader  I pronounced it like the word  awe  so it came out  aw ree   D;2322
980;2023-05-28 03:34:00;8.0;Oh yeah I forgot about  thought  and  drought   I d never heard of  hough   though   that s wild  English is so cruel ;1523
981;2023-05-27 23:44:00;3.0;I got second place in the tri county spelling bee because I had never heard the word  hyperbole  before  I had read it and knew what it meant but assumed it was pronounced hyper bowl  Spelled it hyperbally  ;1088
982;2023-05-28 02:13:00;6.0;Thanks to French s influence on English I find books that are dense with French aren t so bad to understand  Count of Monte Christo  for one  Most of the complex words in English are just   French  Chevalier  from the root word  cheval   doesn t make sense in English like it does in French though   As for pronunciation  French just has its own thing going on  so once I sus out a french word all I need to know is those rules  Takes practice though ;1733
983;2023-05-28 02:35:00;3.0;I remember 7th grade when a girl in class read cocoa  as  coocoo aah  instead of  coh coh   Haven t seen her for 20 years  I still remember ;2128

985;2023-05-28 02:25:00;2.0;When I was in first grade  we had these books that were divided up by reading levels like karate belts   Lowest level books were purple  highest was orange  then there was shapes  etc  and the class would divide into groups of the same reading level  and read the book together out loud   I was in the top tier  reading out about some kids on the beach playing with lobsters  and the teacher interrupted me    Oh  that s not the right word  It s something very similar to lobsters  but it s not lobsters    Cue 7 year old me  staring at my book  looking back up at the teacher and repeating  lobsters    Turned out  every other copy of the book said  crabs   and I was waaay beyond the reading level of those books   Nothing quite like the confusion of staring at the word  lobsters  and trying to figure out what on earth you could be confusing it with ;2405
986;2023-05-27 15:43:00;3.0;it was an animated Peanuts special that made me realize I was mispronouncing the name  Thibault   but in my defence  what kind of a stupid name is that  Schulz ;1473
987;2023-05-27 15:35:00;3.0;There are rules ;608
988;2023-05-27 15:18:00;29.0;At least it s not freaking Colonel Kernel;2069
989;2023-05-27 16:32:00;3.0;I think it s just because it comes from  biographical picture   So it s basically  bio pic   but one word for some reason ;1531
990;2023-05-28 00:35:00;2.0;Yes  Specifically  it sounds like myopic  nearsighted  That s how I pronounced it for years and years ;1303
991;2023-05-27 16:44:00;3.0;I assumed as much  but I also assumed the pronunciation was an immediate thing  Maybe I m just too used to hearing it  correctly   Interesting nonetheless ;614
992;2023-05-27 19:28:00;9.0;Ah yeah  sounds the same as what I dealt with  The middleman  Amazon  always just felt so unnecessary  and kobo does a great job of passing you along so it feels like there isn t a middleman;446
993;2023-05-27 20:09:00;2.0;  for no reason it becomes available on all my Kindle apps and devices   Isn t that the weirdest little quirk  I don t get that either just eliminate the unnecessary step ;1548
994;2023-05-27 22:55:00;40.0;This made me laugh   before I learned French  while in France   I pronounced to a gendarme as a  gender me   When I was in language school I was working so hard on my accent I started pronouncing  beaucoup  as  Beau queue   One of my French friends told me to stop telling the bartender  Thank you  nice ass  ;2073
995;2023-05-27 23:37:00;21.0; whores devours  is a much better error than  whore s ovaries ;2247
996;2023-05-27 15:04:00;3.0;I d never heard of a seax before reading the Bernicia books by Matthew Harffy  and I m still not sure how to pronounce it as I ve never heard it spoken  Best guess is a single syllable  somewhere between sax and sex ;307
997;2023-05-27 17:42:00;13.0;Slough as well  Pronounced either  sloo  in some uses  hydrology   or  sluff  in others  avalanches   or like  loud  but with an S at the front and a silent  gh   as in the English town of Slough   Not to be confused with  slow   to lose speed  moving at low speed  or  slew   also pronounced  sloo  and meaning killed or to turn or slide violently     Because English is a silly language ;2400
998;2023-05-27 17:43:00;3.0;I ve heard colonel in movies and stuff plenty of times and I read it a lot in books  my elementary school library had the Clue books haha  but the first time I realized they were the same word blew my young mind ;1341
999;2023-05-27 17:44:00;20.0;I just call them horse doovers  I know how it s pronounced  but horse doovers is a funnier name for little finger foods ;1297

1002;2023-05-27 22:43:00;17.0;I ve always been and remain a very avid reader but for some reason  for all of my life  I ve been resistant to audiobooks  I don t know why and don t think that it was snobbery  I had no problem with anyone else using audiobooks and never considered them to be a lesser kind of reading  but I had no interest until about 18 months ago    Also  although I read and love all sorts of books from all sorts of genres and authors as varied as Ovid and Heinrich Heine and Edith Wharton and Zadie Smith  science fiction   with a couple of exceptions like A Canticle for Leibowitz  and  Gravity s Rainbow  which are atypical of the genre   is a genre that I ve never been able to sit down and read  despite actually being interested in a lot of the concepts  I do like to listen to podcasts and lectures when I m doing work or laying down so one day I tried to listen to Ursula K Le Guin s  The Dispossessed  and I loved it  since then I ve  read  most of Iain Banks   The Culture   several books by Philip K Dick like  The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch  VALIS  The Divine Invasion  The Transmigration of Timothy Archer  and  Radio Free Albemuth   Octavia Butler s  Xenogenesis  trilogy and I ve just finished Kim Stanley Robinson s  Red Mars  and am about to begin  Green Mars    What s interesting is  I ve purchased copies of most of these books  either to read along or to keep reading when I can t listen to an audiobook for whatever reason  but I still find these books  which I really enjoy listening too  unpleasant or boring to read   Have you experienced anything similar ;1113
1003;2023-05-27 22:57:00;23.0;absolutely  i need easy stuff for audio  mysteries  thrillers  and YA novels are my go to s;1256
1004;2023-05-28 00:43:00;9.0;I have found I m able to listen to a lot heavier  more high brow books  For some reason  I need reading with a real book to be an enjoyable experience  so I stick to things I really like  Otherwise  I just won t pick the book up  I listen to audiobooks in the car on my commute and so I m stuck there  Sometimes  I eventually get into whatever educational thing I m forcing myself to listen to  and really expand my horizons  I m so damn fussy  I have trouble finding books I really like  I reread a lot   so Audible allows me to experiment too ;231
1005;2023-05-28 04:38:00;3.0;I only listen to fiction in audiobook form nowadays  simply because I can do other things when it s on and most of the books I want are available  The readings are good and I can lost in an audiobook as easily as an actual book  A lot of technical stuff is either dry as dust on audiobook or is unavailable in the format  so that s usually either physical book or ebook  History and science are around 50 50  largely due to whether they exist as an audiobook or not  Also  footnotes are crap on audiobook ;50
1006;2023-05-28 15:04:00;3.0;Audiobooks are exclusively for when I m doing other things  generally driving long distances or knitting  Therefore I need simpler  lighter audiobooks for when I stop paying attention for a minute and want to jump back in without having to go back and re listen ;2190
1007;2023-05-29 01:43:00;3.0;Yes  I do tons of nonfiction audiobooks but almost no physical books  In audio they re fascinating and it can hold my attention  In print it s too boring ;251
1008;2023-05-29 04:53:00;2.0;I ll find a narrator I like such as Ray Porter or Wil Wheaton and listen to almost all their books even if I think they sound awful ;613
1009;2023-05-27 19:17:00;2.0;I read more via audiobook than actual print  I can listen while I m working or driving or doing chores  That said  if it s a particularly dense book or has characters with weird names  it s a lot harder ;2017
1010;2023-05-28 19:25:00;2.0;I love listening to memoirs essay collections and historical non fiction but I have little desire to read these genres with my own eyeballs ;785
1011;2023-05-27 22:42:00;2.0;I m kinda picky with audio books myself it usually comes down to the readers voice  Or rather their acting  I personally just want the book read to me not acted out  Since I usually buy kindle books I just use Alexa to read the books too me;1174
1012;2023-05-27 15:57:00;2.0;I ve found that audiobooks actually saved reading for me  I ve been in a book funk on and off since 2020  I ll have two really good books a year but most others have been really forgettable   I think my taste is the same regardless of the medium  But I m more adamant on making sure I like the narrator  There s books I ve been giving a second chance  trying to see if the format difference impacted how I liked the story  And I ve found that it s always been the author and not the format ;543
1013;2023-05-28 01:38:00;2.0;I am much much more picky when it comes to Audiobooks  I tend to not like a lot of them because I usually prefer  my  version of the character s voices lol  The exceptions are when I like the voice or performance so much that I just and up preferring their version  narrators like Richard Poe or Frank Muller  I find that as long as the audio is good and the voice doesnt annoy me  nonfiction is my preferred genre for audiobooks ;500
1014;2023-05-27 23:31:00;1.0;I have found I can not listen to any random audiobook  For print books  it is enough I like the writing and plot and and ideas  and I can read it  But for audiobooks  I have to like also the plot and ideas and writing but I must also like the narrator  their voice  their accent  their interpretation  it adds an extra layer of possible nope   People recommend me something and mention the audiobook  I listen to a sample  and I am nope  out of there  I dislike most narrators  sorry ;1909
1015;2023-05-27 22:59:00;1.0;I m more likely to listen to a book I m unsure about than physically read it  So books by authors I don t know or in genres I m not as big a fan of I listen to more ;2161
1016;2023-05-27 13:56:00;1.0;Yeah  I m willing to listen to short stories or serials   AgroSquirrelNarrates r hfy on YT  I don t read short stories anymore for the most part unless they re  extra content  for a longer form work   If they re any good  I d want more  if there isn t any more to be had  I ll pass   Will just read off screen and skip ahead sometimes  even so   Also nonfiction   I don t want to listen to longer form fictional content ;1573
1017;2023-05-27 13:56:00;1.0;I can t really do fiction with audiobooks  and I only really listen to them while I m on a run or a walk   so I tend to listen to lighter or more humorous non fiction like Jon Ronson or Bill Bryson  Actually running out of books so if anyone is similar I d love some recommendations;405
1018;2023-05-27 14:08:00;1.0;I only do non fiction  which I normally rarely read  and thrillers mysteries on audiobooks  Or if I hear something has an amazing full cast I ll try the audio ;1358
1019;2023-05-27 20:46:00;1.0;I love audiobooks  but I stick to things like thrillers  romance  YA     Anything more complex or thought provoking  I need to be able to read the physical book or ebook    I m not an auditory learner  though     There are probably people who can process audio books better than physical books ;1385
1020;2023-05-28 03:35:00;1.0;Physical books  non fiction  very specific fiction I had as a child  maybe a tad of branching out   Audiobooks    select sword and sorcery or scifi libraries    sort by duration     select the longest titles that are single books    don t bother looking at the description    purchase   I ve only hated 1 so far ;2045
1021;2023-05-27 13:49:00;1.0;Absolutely  I have finished poorly constructed books with amazing readers but have DNF the same books in the first chapter when reading for myself  That sounds awful but as a developmental editor  I almost always catch major holes in finished  published works that don t seem to bother me in an audio version ;965
1022;2023-05-27 21:02:00;1.0;There s this type of audiobook voice I don t like at all and it s found in many modern mystery books with a female narrator  A type of  i m so bored with everything and better than everyone around me  vibe it gives off  It s probably something to do with the type of characters these books tend to have  maybe  But I can t do it anymore    I find audiobooks for classics easier and they have really  really talented narrators  This Jane Austin narrator was perfect for helping me understand stuff that might have went over my head if not for tone of voice  I also like nonfiction audiobooks better than reading nonfiction  Some audiobooks are just superbly acted in general  the Demon Copperhead audiobook is SO well performed    Now Terry Pratchett all the Discworld I m going through lately I have to use my eyes alone because half the jokes are visual and word puns and all that ;472
1023;2023-06-01 01:25:00;1.0;I started listening to audiobooks with easy mysteries   other fiction  often something I d read in print years before so missing some wouldn t hurt since I m always doing something else like driving  mowing the lawn  weeding  etc   As my ability to process the audio got better  I moved into books I d wanted to read  but put me to sleep or were just impenetrable for some reason   I found I could listen to many of them although I still drift off on a few   Anyway  I started listening to more nonfiction until that was most of the books I read   I listened to a lot of The Great Course lecture series  too   So long as visuals aren t needed too often  they re great ;2054
1024;2023-05-27 14:07:00;1.0;I listen to books on audible and usually while driving or at work if doing a menial task by myself  Since books cost the same regardless of length  and they pretty much serve to relieve boredom the duration of the book is much more important  Several audiobooks I ve passed up on because they re  10 hours and cost the same amount of money as something that is 20 30 hours   Very dense books I find I prefer on audiobook  I couldn t get into the game of thrones books because of how much time GRRM spends describing every little thing  there was no room left for me to imagine what was going on in any given scene  whereas the audiobooks were absolutely fine;2241
1025;2023-05-27 15:40:00;1.0;The narration is a massive part of the experience  If the narrator repeatedly misreads or mispronounces words then it just pulls you out of it  You want to be able to focus less on the voice and more on the words ;397
1026;2023-05-27 15:03:00;7.0;Same   Only listening to stuff where it s okayish to miss a minute or two ;85
1027;2023-05-27 17:06:00;1.0;Also same  I have trouble picturing like fantasy or complex worlds with just audio only  I need to physically read more complex books myself  but enjoy audiobooks for more realistic  east leading fiction ;1362

1029;2023-05-27 20:12:00;2.0;What I strongly dislike is when they give each character a distinctive voice of their own or is otherwise highly animated  I find that it takes me out and limits my own capacity to get into a character s head and see them in my own way  that feels an imposition of meaning onto a text ;2423

1033;2023-05-27 21:52:00;0.0;I ve never really been a book reader  Most of my time growing up was spent playing video games or watching YouTube  But now that I m an adult WFH  there s a lot more free time I have between when I m working and when I m not  Most of that time is still occupied by video gaming  but some part of me thinks it should be more productively spent and that I should be  doing something   So I thought  Why not spend it reading    But I only get through about a quarter or half of a book before I grow bored of it and put it on the shelf    So my urge to read only really comes from a place of feeling the need to occupy my time  Not because I want to read about some great adventure or romance plot or even something historical  And  as I said before  once I grow tired of that topic  onto the shelf it goes ;1791

1035;2023-05-27 17:20:00;5.0;I also love video games  and Youtube and see it all as different types of entertainment  I just read because I really want to read this book  if I am bored I dont do it  The only sense of obligation I feel is due to it being a thing I bought  so I have this idea of getting  my money s worth  but that is still dependent on if i m enjoying the thing or not  If its boring  don t read it ;626

1037;2023-05-27 22:44:00;7.0;People read for all sorts of reasons and some people just aren t readers  I m an avid reader and I like to read for fun and to learn things  my husband of over 30 years doesn t read at all  He has the ability to read  he just prefers to do other things with his time  He will buy books to learn a new programming language and skim it to get what he needs  but that s the only type of book I ve ever seen him open    IMHO reading is not better or worse use of your time than any other hobby and this idea that all of our time needs to be productive is causing stress and burnout  There is nothing wrong with having quiet leisure time  If you are content with your current situation then enjoy it  If you feel you want to expand some part of your life then figure out what it is and go for it ;70
1038;2023-05-27 23:12:00;2.0;Try to read only what really interests you or makes your curious about it  Don t read out of an obligation or read top 50 classic novels because you think you re supposed to to be a better reader person  Find what makes you curious and that should drive you to read more about it  The world is huge and dudes will write about anything and everything ;76
1039;2023-05-27 23:22:00;1.0;Whenever I feel like I m reading too much fiction I turn to non fiction  Pick a subject that interests  you and pick up a non fiction book about it ;884
1040;2023-05-27 14:27:00;1.0;I mean  I most likely wouldn t want to read some great adventure or romance plot either  What are you actually trying to read  Would you like to tell us a bit about the games you generally play and why  Do you get bored with those  Do you switch between games  because switching between books is also an option   If you can t be bothered learning basically anything and just came to tell us that  then by all means watch paint dry  but usually there is  something  ;825

1045;2023-05-27 19:26:00;17.0;Personally I ve found that for best results  on your next roadtrip go somewhere where there are either a lot of people or a lot of people who read  big city or college town  and just spend the afternoon bouncing from store to store   I mean  it s not technically the cheapest way because some of them will be independent bookstores selling at full price but it is a lot of fun  Like a treasure hunt ;2420
1046;2023-05-27 13:47:00;15.0;My favorite thing about the used bookstore is the hunt of the books I want  I go in once a week hoping I find one of the books to complete a collection  usually my collections come together in the wrong order because I just get what I can from the used book store  Feels like cheating going to Barnes or using Amazon  The universe delivers the books you need at the used book store  And if you re in Ohio check if there s a Half Priced Books near you   Edit  wrong your ;617

1111;2023-05-27 23:49:00;25.0;That s my favorite to go to  My local one has a sale 4 times a year and it s  2  3 for a paperback and  5 for a hardback  You can t beat that price anywhere  and even better with all the proceeds going to benefit the local library system ;620
1112;2023-05-28 12:47:00;15.0;Being able to keep the books for such a low price outweighs the benefits of the libraries selection  Once you ve gotten enough books in bulk from the used book store you can get that  library  feeling of discovery from your own shelves  At least it happens for me ;2421
1113;2023-05-28 00:04:00;8.0;We have a good library  but I  do  care to own my books    and the subdivision quadrant our house is in had a weird paperwork quirk that meant it couldn t be incorporated into the city  so we instead pay county taxes  but those don t go to the library so we d have to pay several hundred dollars per year to get a library card   Which I d do if we had kids  but we don t  so I m happy to put some of that money into building my own library each year  and to donate to the city library on occasion     Yard and estate sales are also great places to find used books for cheap ;2236
1114;2023-05-27 13:35:00;3.0;If your library has a link to suggest books  you can use that to suggest books  just to let them know there is an audience for better reading material out there  Most allow you to suggest multiple books a month ;591
1115;2023-05-27 15:19:00;6.0;Step 1  find out which books Christians truly value   Step 2  complain about those books to the same places Christians complain about good books   Step 3  sit back and relax while Christians complain about being unfairly targetted  hopefully  ;1097
1116;2023-05-27 15:33:00;7.0;18 holds on 9 copies will get that book in your hands in a few weeks or less  There s pretty much no book that I can t wait for   There are also discount websites like you mention and I love little free libraries  Often there s garbage books in there  but quite often there are amazing books ;786
1117;2023-05-27 12:54:00;3.0;Maybe it s just my library  but they have a section called Friends of the Library Best Sellers  You can only get them by walking in  you can t reserve them  So if you see that there are 38 holds on 9 copies  it s possible that there is a copy  sometimes many copies  on those best seller shelves   One perk of being a  friend  of the library is finding out these secrets  ;806
1118;2023-05-27 15:55:00;1.0;yeah  i need to get on and look around some more  post reminded me of it;510
1119;2023-05-27 22:58:00;2.0;I disagree  Maybe you lump antique stores and consignment stores into the same categories as well  I dunno  They are vastly different to me    A book store SPECIALIZES in books  They will have an inventory system  and the staff is likely familiar with a wide variety of books and authors  Their books are likely to be highly organized    Thrift stores are a bit more of a crapshoot  which is why they can be great    The St  Vinnies by me has several shelves of overpriced X box and Playstation games  Are they now a  used video game store  ;690
1120;2023-05-27 12:11:00;0.0;Ah yes  my favorite 2nd hand bookstore  the internet;676
1121;2023-05-27 19:47:00;2.0;All true  but goodwill book prices are definitely the cheapest  since I m sure clothing drives most of their profit  unlike a bookstore ;1962
1122;2023-05-27 15:26:00;3.0;Nah  my local bookstore people are cool as hell  considering the books are like 5 cents each if you pack them right ;498
1123;2023-05-27 13:42:00;7.0;I ve got to be on the lookout for library sales ;392
1124;2023-05-27 14:45:00;1.0;That s a good idea  I do just like owning my books  though  Especially my foreign language books  Makes living here feel a bit more like home;1466
1125;2023-05-27 15:56:00;6.0;I don t have time to troll an entire group of people   I m busy reading ;402
1126;2023-05-27 17:26:00;3.0;I love little free libraries ;1571
1127;2023-05-27 18:02:00;1.0;Not so sure about that  been a while but i found 5 st king paper backs all in mint  from Abebooks  2 of them shipped from england eu to the states and total cost was 18 n change  around the same time i had been in a gw and all paperbacks were a flat 5 each plus of course sale tax ;1362
1128;2023-05-27 18:32:00;14.0;There s a website for that   Book Sale Finder  https   www booksalefinder com  ;990
1129;2023-05-27 19:47:00;4.0;Sign up for your nearby libraries  mailing lists    they ll let you know when sales are approaching ;633
1130;2023-05-27 13:48:00;1.0;Yes  I like to have books around too  But they do pile up      ;2086
1131;2023-05-27 15:45:00;1.0;This is great    Thanks for sharing ;465
1132;2023-05-27 17:40:00;1.0;That s absolutely fair;937
1133;2023-05-27 18:08:00;98.0;I ve always been insanely picky with western fiction but I find myself endlessly re reading all of Louis L Amour s stuff  Honestly no other author for me aside from I guess Cormac McCarthy exudes such strong and authentic Wild West atmosphere  He also just simply tells such fun stories  I ve literally never wanted to put a book of his down no matter the length even just for a second because I m always so consistently engaged ;245
1134;2023-05-27 18:52:00;7.0;There s kind of a formula to them after a while  but I went through a huge Louis Lamour phase as a teen and can still recall the first few books I read that he wrote  One was Comstock Lode  the second was Last of the Breed  Both were given to me by my Great Uncle Clyde  he had a full set of westerns and was excited to share   Last of the Breed had some mold on the inside cover so I tossed it when I was done  much to the horror of my sister who hadn t finished it and  had just pages left  That took a lot of patching up to mend the relationship ;259
1135;2023-05-27 18:57:00;7.0;The way Louis L Amour gets a story up on its feet and running in about 15 pages is such fun reading for me ;2423
1136;2023-05-27 19:13:00;6.0;If you like L Amour  you should try Elmore Leonard s westerns ;840
1137;2023-05-27 19:41:00;5.0;I m not into them myself  but my dad read them obsessively;227
1138;2023-05-27 20:00:00;5.0;Read the Last of the Breed to see him write about the cold War  I still need to find an excuse to reread this one  His best in my opinion ;813
1139;2023-05-27 22:56:00;5.0;Try Larry McMurtry   ;192
1140;2023-05-28 00:09:00;9.0;I m not really into westerns  but a Louis L Amour book was the first audiobook i ever heard  They were amazingly good for zoning out on a long road trip  Can t tell you if it was the narrator s voice or the story itself  but top notch stuff ;1287
1141;2023-05-28 01:18:00;3.0;This thread has made me want to check out his stuff but the sheer number of books looks a bit overwhelming  Is there any consensus on the best place to start ;243
1142;2023-05-28 03:15:00;11.0;I often recommend his memoir  An Education of a Wandering Man   I think that s the title   He lead a genuinely interesting life  and lived some of what he writes about such as being truly thirsty in the desert  or taking a real hit to the face  Additionally  being born in the early 1900s he had and made use of the chances to meet and engage with Cowboys and Indians that actually fought each other in the later 1800  He traveled the world and was kind of an old man by the time he served in the Navy in WWII  I wish he had survived to this day because I think he would have some wisdom to share with today s  men  about what being a man is really about  Many men who think themselves manly might be more apt to listen to a literary icon who wrote characters and stories they think they can  or want to be able to relate to  Many would surely spurn his advice and say he d gone woke  but I like to think he d have the ability to plant a seed that might eventually disabuse many of the notion that men such as Donald Trump or Josh Hawley are in any form a positive representation of masculinity  I don t mean to turn this comment political  but they re just two examples whom come to mind than most here might know of and recognize as buffoons who feign manliness and talk about being men   At the very least  people would recognize someone who was manly in a traditional sense and exceptionally well read by any standard ;2155
1143;2023-05-28 03:51:00;2.0;I have read Hondo  and I found it very entertaining ;1775
1144;2023-05-28 04:48:00;2.0;Look into Zane Grey ;269
1145;2023-05-28 04:51:00;2.0;There was a bestof post about Louis L Amour a while back  https   www reddit com r bestof comments uunl4c ;1450
1146;2023-05-28 06:01:00;2.0;My dad has nearly the entirety of L Amour s bibliography  definitely most of  if not all  of his westerns  I ve borrowed two  but both were out of his classic western wheelhouse   The Walking Drum and The Haunted Mesa  I wasn t super keen on either  unfortunately  They weren t terrible  but The Walking Drum was hard for me to complete    Admittedly  my dad was so excited to lend them to me  I really felt extra obliged not to DNR lol   It s been a couple of years now  so I can t fully remember why they didn t work for me  If I remember correctly  The Haunted Mesa  though I preferred it   it s also shorter  had some  extremely  tiresome repetition  like I put the book down and rolled my eyes multiple times it got so annoying   I ve always wanted to borrow a proper western because I imagine it s where he shines  I just haven t figured out where best to start ;2176
1147;2023-05-28 10:08:00;2.0;If you like westerns you should checkout out the painter Mark Maggorie  He s a French guy who paints westerns scenes  I have his work on rotation on my work laptop   https   www markmaggiori com ;1815
1148;2023-05-30 00:08:00;2.0;I ve read a lot  perhaps most  of his books over the years   I ll agree he writes a fine  engaging tale   I ll second reading his  Education of a Wandering Man    My favorites were  Bendigo Shafter     Comstock Lode      For other authors  McMurtry is good  but I think Donald Hamilton might write the best   It s hard to find his books  much less westerns  though   He only wrote a few  although one  Ambush at Blanco Canyon   I think   was made into the movie  The Big Country   1958  starring Gregory Peck  Jean Simmons  Charlton Heston  Burl Ives    Chuck Connors     I d recommend against  Zane Grey   Try one   see  but I ve tried several over the years   thought the writing was awful ;2118
1149;2023-05-30 06:17:00;2.0;Oh for about 60 years;1571
1150;2023-05-27 13:15:00;3.0;When I used to own bookstores they were considered the best by the Boomer crowd  I read a couple  and they were OK  If you enjoy them be sure to check out Zane Grey as well ;874
1151;2023-05-27 19:18:00;1.0;The Cherokee Trail was one of the first  adult  novels I read just for fun    Honestly it might be one of hist best books  Surprised I don t see it championed more for featuring a woman as a protagonist and station owner proprietor ;662
1152;2023-05-27 21:29:00;1.0;Been wanting to read more westerns  What books would you recommend from him ;226
1153;2023-05-27 15:12:00;1.0;My spouse s aunt and uncle were huge fans  Picked up a book of several of his stories at a shop when we were vacationing in the southwest  Read them out loud while we were traveling and visiting sights  Such warm memories ;277
1154;2023-05-27 20:41:00;1.0;I absolutely was as a teenager   I read them all a bunch of times ;1207
1155;2023-05-29 02:23:00;1.0;His more traditional westerns are great of course but I really enjoy his forays into the weird and paranormal  while still generally keeping a western setting   The Haunted Mesa  for example ;360
1156;2023-05-27 18:54:00;1.0;Supposedly the inspiration of the Tom Hanks movie  Castaway  came from a Charlie Rose interview with LL about his experience being on a deserted island during WWII or something  Hafta google it ;275
1157;2023-05-28 00:47:00;1.0;If yall can suggest just one of his books to read  which should it be ;1781
1158;2023-05-27 23:40:00;1.0;I really have enjoyed some of Louis L Amour non western work  It is very hard finding good pulps of set in other parts of the world  Though I am eager to try some of his westerns one day ;1443
1159;2023-05-27 22:12:00;1.0;He was my Dad s favorite author  I don t really know what book to start with  My local library has an entire shelf just for him  Any recommendations ;1262
1160;2023-05-28 03:15:00;1.0;Louis L Amour writes about in his books he has actually been to IRL ;786
1161;2023-05-27 15:13:00;1.0;One of my favorite books is The Haunted Mesa ;169
1162;2023-05-27 21:57:00;1.0;I recently came into possession of nearly a dozen of his books  I ve been tempted to write a Western  and thought he might be worth the read  I ve even got an unofficial biography of him  He seems like an interesting author ;1861
1163;2023-05-27 16:57:00;1.0;I ADORE Louis L amour  He was a huge part of my teenage and he may have single handedly taught me to appreciate the Western genre of films  I still read him and I m nearly thirty  Just recently I found the ultra rare  at least in this country  Sackett s Land at a secondhand bookstore and that means I just need two more books to complete the Sackett saga  Once I do  I m doing a total re read and going back to one of the best parts of my childhood;1920
1164;2023-05-27 22:14:00;1.0;Just read my first last month  Hondo   Which others would you recommend ;82
1165;2023-05-27 23:36:00;1.0;OP  what were your favorites  I wanted to try Westerns  I tried Burning Hills and felt very bored  I saw someone else mention audiobooks so I might try those ;1528
1166;2023-05-28 07:21:00;1.0;Louis L Amour was the author that got me into westerns  Eminently readable  kind of formulaic  easily digestible  This was in the ealy 70 s  At that time westerns were  was   a much larger genre than it is now  There were so many authors always available on the shelves in both libraries and bookstores  larger than science fiction fantasy in those days   Clair Huffaker  Max Brand  John Reese  and so many others  But westerns went out of  style  and many of those authors are out of print  and hard to find  I miss new books in the style of those days ;718
1167;2023-05-27 21:14:00;1.0;I have read many books by Louis L Amour while in school  but I can t recall the names of any  On the other hand  I can recall the names of most westerns by Oliver Strange which I read during the same period  I can even remember  the names of many characters from Oliver Strange s Sudden series of books  which was later continued by Fredrick H  Christian  Sudden is by far my favorite character in westerns    Another unforgettable western that I read in school Is Shane by Jack Schaefer    As an adult  the only western that I have read is Lonesome Dove  and it is one of the best books that I have ever read ;1575
1168;2023-05-28 00:10:00;1.0;For someone who has never read any of this  what book would you recommend to start with ;1832
1169;2023-05-28 00:50:00;1.0;He s my favorite author  I ve read probably 100 of his books  and I ve re read quite a few  some three or four times ;1274
1170;2023-05-27 19:01:00;0.0;I started Lonesome Dove and after 20 pages of nothing happening I returned it to the library  I might return to it but it seems to start slowly ;2331
1171;2023-05-28 00:29:00;5.0;So many broad shoulders;83
1172;2023-05-27 20:00:00;2.0;Last of the Breed was a great book  One of the few that aren t a western ;1073
1173;2023-05-28 01:34:00;2.0;I m pretty sure they re produced by his kids  and they re acted  not just read  It s really great when you re driving through the west and surrounded by the scenery being described ;820
1174;2023-05-28 03:19:00;2.0;I ve never read a western  although I am toying with reading Lonesome Dove  but I absolutely loved Education of a Wandering Man  he had so much background info to draw from and was probably the most voracious reader I ve ever heard of ;997
1175;2023-05-28 11:46:00;2.0;One of my favourite books of all time  I read it before even reading any of his fiction ;211
1176;2023-05-28 12:04:00;3.0;Colonel Potter recommended and approved ;1587
1177;2023-05-27 10:36:00;2.0;The Walking Drum is the only book of his I ve read and I really like it  I wish he d have gotten to write the follow up novels  but he passed away ;1606
1178;2023-05-27 11:14:00;2.0;I haven t read Zanes books but I still remember reading a short story he had written  The writing was so incredibly vivid  and it was about these Indians being persecuted  forced to walk over cacti   anyway it really stuck with me  I wonder if his writing style is better for shorter works ;2195
1179;2023-05-27 11:17:00;2.0;The Walking Drum is his masterpiece in my opinion  One of the best historical novels of all time as far as I m concerned;1389
1180;2023-05-27 14:24:00;1.0;Just got a copy of that a few weeks ago  I m looking forward to reading it ;350
1181;2023-05-27 12:06:00;15.0;That s Larry McMurtry  Definitely slower paced  but more character depth in my opinion ;1452
1182;2023-05-27 10:19:00;4.0;One of my favorite things about Lonesome Dove is that the action hits you right in the face when you least expect it  There were many times I had to reread a paragraph because my brain said  hold up  did that just happen   It s very character focused and takes its time getting going but the action definitely picks up ;1071
1183;2023-05-27 10:58:00;3.0;Lonesome Dove is one of the strangest books I ve ever read   plenty of times when I was reading it I was bored but whenever I put it down I was desperate to pick it up again because I loved the characters so much     My copy is 800 or so pages long and the story didn t even start until I reached the 200 s  the beginning was just a load of characters falling in love with the same prostitute ha     I ve literally just finished Dead Mans Walk  the first prequel  and enjoyed that much more ;1508
1184;2023-05-27 15:03:00;2.0;I think it could be considered more of a neo western;1016
1185;2023-05-27 15:05:00;1.0;I remember feeling like the book in a meta way resembled the main character  Like it was almost a western  but instead was searching for where the  new  westerns belong in the modern world ;1995
1186;2023-05-27 11:27:00;2.0;Exactly  i was driving from El Paso to Alburquerque  Definitely helped with the old west vibe        And acted audiobooks are amazing  I listened to this 25ish years ago so the memory is pretty vague  I just remember that it was really good   ;796
1187;2023-05-27 12:36:00;5.0;You should absolutely read Lonesome Dove  So great ;2119
1188;2023-05-27 15:41:00;2.0;Could be or it works for you   not for me   I can be very picky   It s worth reading at least something like his  Riders of the Purple Sage  simply because it s referenced so much   That goes for a lot of the old ones   To our taste or not  they re part of the evolution of our current literature ;1555
1189;2023-05-27 12:12:00;1.0;The Walking Drum is the only book of his I ve read  I m not really a fan of westerns  but someone recommended it to me  I wish he d have gotten to finish the series ;1222
1190;2023-05-27 12:12:00;3.0;It s only slow in the beginning  really  Once they actually get on the trail theres quite a lot happening all the time ;1828
1191;2023-05-27 11:05:00;2.0;Fair point  My taste in books is also really odd sometimes    It is really interesting to read older works and process through where the writer was coming from and how their work is a product of the times  I read a ton of very old historical fiction for awhile from the 1870s 1890s and it was really fascinating to pick that apart ;1507
1192;2023-05-27 12:01:00;3.0;This right here  The lead up to the cattle drive is necessary for the rest of the novel  but it is probably the only  boring  section overall ;1026
1193;2023-05-27 12:07:00;3.0;My taste  too   We have horses  have always had them    I ve lived on a ranch in Colorado  so that can really damage books when the author just gets their  facts  from other fiction   I agree about the historical perspective  I find it fascinating  too  For about a decade now  I ve moderated the  Evolution of Science Fiction  group on  Goodreads com  https   Goodreads com  so it s a familiar topic with tech  social norms  etc   I m in my 60s   we ve had HUGE changes to the social norms during my lifetime    Stranger in a Strange Land   1962  by Heinlein was once held up as an example of a man promoting the equality of women  but most young readers think it s misogynistic   So it goes   ;2272
1194;2023-05-27 13:46:00;1.0;That s so interesting  I ll have to check Heinlen out   Rabbit trail here but I really think that s why the Dune movie that came out recently was so popular   it s based off of a book that s got a different perspective than the current culture  so it feels  new   even though it s actually old and that s why it s different  I haven t read the book  I know  I know  but I want to read it and compare book to movie and see what is the author and what s the director now ;184
1195;2023-05-27 13:51:00;2.0;I first read  Dune  in the 70s   have read it several times since   I recommend it as a standalone   I m not a fan of the sequels to the book which has spawned a huge  popular series   That includes the 2d book   Dune Messiah  which Herbert originally included in the first  I m in the minority  but editors can be an author s best friend   cutting that book out of the first was a huge improvement     I m not a fan of the latest movie  either   Great visuals  but it missed capturing the heart of the story  IMO  As bad as the 1984 movie is  it did a far better job in that area   The 2000 mini series wasn t bad either   If you re not familiar with the book  it s easy to miss  though   Heinlein s work prior to 1970 was heavily constrained by editors   publishers   He wrote fantastic short stories   juveniles  most prior to 1960   Both are worth reading as an adult   were particularly influential to my teenage years  They were filled with a lot of space adventures that were solved by science  logic    fidelity  A bit cheesy  probably more for guys rather than girls due to the main character s sex    Have Space Suit  Will Travel  has a fun female character with a fairly prominent role in it   so do  Tunnel In The Sky     The Star Beast        Heinlein wasn t much for diverse characters   He had one leading character of 3 ages   If they were female  they were just a guy with breasts   a cosmetic change only  I like the character   was more interested in the settings   solutions  so it works for me   Heinlein is another whose editors were his best friends   His first novel remained unpublished until after his death   It reads like his post 1970 novels where he could ignore the editors   publishers   It resulted in books that are overlong   preachy  I ll recommend  Stranger in a Strange Land   but read the original publication  not the one with all his original text restored   The extra words add nothing but time   irritation  IMO    The Moon is a Harsh Mistress  is a favorite of mine  His other books during the 1960s are a mixed bag   The first half of  Glory Road  is great fun   Farnaham s Freehold  is cringeworthy   The Door Into Summer  was good until I read his later works   then it becomes somewhat creepy   In 1970  Heinlein almost died from some brain problem   He wrote  I Will Fear No Evil  which should be avoided  After 1970  Heinlein got really weird about sex   started putting incestuous relationships in his books  Unlike his friend  Theodore Sturgeon  The couples belonged to the same nudist colony   he seems serious about promoting it   Just yuck   Sturgeon wrote a short story about it that is definitely worth reading  If All Men Were Brothers  Would You Let Your Sister Marry One      I m rambling   Enjoy ;2441
1196;2023-05-27 14:39:00;2.0;Thank you for the ramble  It s rambling like yours that makes me appreciate Reddit  I might go pick some sci fi back up  it s been awhile   ;1227
1197;2023-05-27 15:09:00;39.0;I like being able to read a whole saga back to back  Otherwise  if I have to wait several years before installments  I forget about the story  realize I should re read the previous books and fret about re reading stuff when there s so many books out there    Do you feel the same way  How do you approach unfinished sagas you re chomping at the bit to delve into ;945
1198;2023-05-27 15:14:00;58.0;I used to not get into unfinished series due to being burned  looking at you Martin and Rothfuss  but I ve gotten more willing to dive into an unfinished series as long as the author has a track record of  being able to actually finish ;535
1199;2023-05-27 15:15:00;21.0;I used to care a lot about being able to read an entire series  and I avoided some stellar stuff because I was certain they would never be finished  As I ve gotten older  I ve become more about the journey rather than the destination  and learned to accept that some things in life are worth it even if they can t ever be completed ;1006
1200;2023-05-27 15:47:00;50.0;If nobody buys the first books  the final books don t get written;434
1201;2023-05-27 15:47:00;7.0;I ve never avoided a series because it wasn t finished   Sometimes I might need a recap  but rereading a book or using a character index or looking up a summary or just powering through works out well enough   I also watch movies that I know are going ot have sequels  like Dune  and TV shows that haven t conclude their full plot even after several seasons  and played episodic games   If I didn t  I d basically have missed out on some of the greatest media of our time  or been so late to it that most of it would be spoiled  or I d forget about it  etc ;1551
1202;2023-05-27 15:48:00;10.0;Yes  Asoiaf burned me like so many else but I feel like I d just missing out on so many great books by restricting myself like that  Most series get finished  GRRM is the exception  not the rule ;1565
1203;2023-05-27 16:16:00;5.0;I love finished series and tend to sway toward them when looking for a new read   But that being said  I have a few authors whom I m crazy for  and I can t seem to wait for a whole saga to be completed before starting those ;1670
1204;2023-05-27 16:18:00;4.0;Yes  but usually only when I ve read previous books by the author or it started out as a smaller series and more books a spin off were added later  like the red rising series where you can stop after book three   I kinda want to try the game of thrones series  but I will only start it if it gets finished given how unlikely that s looking ;2101
1205;2023-05-27 16:34:00;4.0;I actually love reading them  I like looking forward to the next one and the excitement when it finally comes out ;1579
1206;2023-05-27 16:35:00;4.0;So I have been waiting for six years to start reading A wise man s fear  part 2 to The name of the wind  because I wanted to wait until Rothfuss announced when he was gonna publish part 3  so I would have to wait less between parts 2 and 3  I wish I had not been that stupid because after six years I can assure you I don t remember anything and would need to reread it again anyway    ;1210
1207;2023-05-27 16:48:00;8.0;Yes  Very often I don t bother reading the second or subsequent books in a series  anyway  It s not a big deal ;1553
1208;2023-05-27 16:49:00;3.0;Absolutely  In the YA game  most things are series and I ve gotten used to picking up the first book in a series    I don t typically worry about authors not finishing  I ve never had that issue before  Yes  I have bad ADHD memory but I ll just reread what I have and keep collecting the books  If a series is already complete  now I do wait until I have all the books to read  but that mostly only applies to series I am collecting used that I read through libraries   I have several series I ve never finished reading  either because the final book was unavailable to me  or I didn t know more books came out  or I simply didn t care to continue   I ve come to learn that  depending on the  series  sequels are completely optional  Like I recently read The Hazel Wood  it was good  but I don t really feel like reading the sequel and there s no cliffhanger or anything so I m not missing out on much    I guess this is indicative more of how often I ve been burnt by good first books  terrible sequels  There are many many books out there that were fine as standalones  or with what they had and didn t need more added  once again  a sort of commonality amongst YA I ve found ;1804
1209;2023-05-27 17:00:00;3.0;Sometimes    Sometimes it s because the series isn t really a series and won t ever finish  Like C  J  Cherryh s Alliance Union books  They re all part of the same setting  and all the stories are connected to the same shared history  But almost all of them can be read as standalone novels  The history of that setting won t ever be finished  The author will just stop writing at some point    Then there s Dune  which ended unfiinshed because the author died before publishing the conclusion  There s no way around that  If you read Dune  you ve started an unfinished series    On the other hand  there s series like GoT and KKC  which are unfinished not because the author s life ran out before the story did  but because the author s motivation ran out before the story did  And yeah  I started both of those  and the Gentlemen Bastards  too    And then there s stuff like Barry Eisler s John Rain books and their spinoffs  which always seem to circle back to John Rain at some point   Is the series finished  Who knows  Eisler s still writing  and could contribute another book to the  Rainiverse  at any time  When he does  I ll be there for it    In general  I try to avoid series that are supposed to have a conclusion  but don t  because the author lost interest  Series that are more open ended  or that were unfinished because the author dies  I will still read ;1377
1210;2023-05-27 18:35:00;6.0;If I suspect it will be finished yes  if not no   When I started ASOIAF and Kingkiller it looked promising that they would get finished or at least in the realm of possibility  but I wouldnt recommend anyone start them now;493
1211;2023-05-27 18:46:00;8.0;There s no way I m getting back to ASOIAF ;520
1212;2023-05-27 18:46:00;2.0;Dead Souls was my one exception  Hell  the first book isn t even finished   It s possibly my most re read book ;1373
1213;2023-05-27 19:56:00;2.0;I started The Obernewtyn Chronicles in 2002 and finished it in 2020  Never again ;1363
1214;2023-05-27 19:57:00;2.0;Sure  I ve read Harry Potter  Wheel of Time  Destroyermen  and A Song of Ice and Fire as the books were published ;1469
1215;2023-05-27 20:18:00;2.0;I don t like it when a series of books isn t finished either  But I still buy them and wait until I collect everything  Only then do I start reading them  I dream of making my own library with my favorite books at home ;1182
1216;2023-05-27 20:44:00;2.0;After The Wheel of Time  I am very careful about starting long series   I research the author s track record and health now haha   That series ended up being finished by another author  but there was a perceptible difference in style ;1736
1217;2023-05-27 21:12:00;2.0;If I ve either heard good things about the series or I didn t know it was in progress  I will  But most of the time  I pick up book series that are finished ;834
1218;2023-05-27 21:29:00;2.0;I read mysteries and they are almost always series  I have read many series that are 25 30 books with 1 published a year  Why put off the enjoyment of what s available to read now for decades as I wait for the series to finish   If characters are a problem  get a notebook or sketchbook and keep track as you read the series  You can make your own timeline and whatever else seems important   Happy reading ;889
1219;2023-05-27 21:39:00;2.0;My position is that good writing is deserving of an audience whether it s a completely finished work or not  And even with series that finish strong  people remain engaged with those characters and stories and want to think about what happens next look at how much Harry Potter fanfic there is   It s a testament to books being good and worth reading that people want more    As I ve gotten older I ve gotten more philosophical about this  You can t guarantee that a series will be finished or finished well   Sometimes series start strong and finish strong  Sometimes the author finishes the series but the later books just aren t as good  or it ends in a way you don t like  Sometimes publishers don t want to keep a series going because of sales  Sometimes an author loses interest in a story or has other series going that sell better or has personal stuff going on that makes it hard to write   It s honestly kind of a miracle that any series gets finished   I try to appreciate what there is and not worry too much about whether it s done    Take ASOIF  for instance  I would love to know how it all wraps up  I would  But it doesn t mean I don t appreciate the world building or the characters or the intricate plotting or the sheer magnitude of the labor that went into what is already there  Should I not read great books because there aren t more of them   Or should I just appreciate what s available   Tl Dr it s the journey not the destination ;1144
1220;2023-05-27 23:37:00;2.0;I absolutely do if I support the author and like their writing  Right now I m reading the second book of an unfinished trilogy by Stephen Graham Jones  I read My Heart Is A Chainsaw  and am now onto Don t Fear The Reaper which is the second book and was released this year  I love his writing and other books  and I don t regret it at all  After reading the second book I can t imagine the first one without it  and I know the third one will have the same effect because of the author that he is ;195
1221;2023-05-28 00:49:00;2.0;Burned by Kingkiller  never again ;249
1222;2023-05-28 03:57:00;2.0;I do it all the time  Unfinished series don t really bother me  I enjoy the anticipation of  what s going to happen next    I also prefer weekly shows for a similar reason vs binging    I loved growing up with Harry Potter   always getting to look forward to the next book in the series  Granted  no series I m currently reading has matched that level of excitement  but maybe one day ;658
1223;2023-05-28 12:57:00;2.0;Im usually late to the party so I don t mind reading unfinished series  Right now im actually half way through A Dance with Dragons and I always figured I might as well catch up in case Martin ever releases the next entry     ;273
1224;2023-05-28 17:06:00;2.0;If I refused to read unfinished series I wouldn t have gotten to read Melanie Rawn s Ruins of Ambrai and Mageborn Traitor and that would be a hell of a loss  Plus  the last Cave Bear book eventually showed up and that taught me not to give up hope;1930
1225;2023-05-28 21:06:00;2.0;Me personally I ll find a book I like in a saga get to find the eta of the next book and then read said book a month in advance of the next book coming out  I hope that made sense ;815
1226;2023-05-29 06:39:00;2.0;It can be frustrating  I finally bought the final book in the Expanse series because it just came out in paperback  For the life of me I can t remember what point the plot is at or who is who ;1459
1227;2023-05-29 08:09:00;2.0;I prefer series where each book tells a complete story but the characters develop across the series  That used to be a lot more common ;2172
1228;2023-05-29 08:14:00;2.0;I have stopped  If the series isn t complete  I won t start  Rothfuss burned me  but so did Sue Townsend  She died before the final Adrian Mole book  and that was just heartbreaking   But I find it s more that new books are so much more expensive than older ones  So starting an unfinished series means committing more of my book budget to less reading ;1666
1229;2023-05-29 12:17:00;2.0;Not anymore  Was burned with Martind and Rothfuss  Now I either read one offs or I wait till trilogies are finished ;700
1230;2023-05-27 10:52:00;2.0;I try not to  but I don t always remember to look ;1581
1231;2023-05-27 15:33:00;2.0;I ve read Game of Thrones  so  yea I do;1235
1232;2023-05-27 17:34:00;2.0;Yes  Yes   YES    If you don t buy the books the author will stop because   they won t get paid    The publishers won t renew the contract   If you don t read it unfinished it never will be ;528
1233;2023-05-27 17:52:00;2.0;I read one or none  If I hear good things  I read the first book and then leave it until it s complete  Or if I m on the fence I just wait until it s all done;110
1234;2023-05-27 18:27:00;2.0;Depends how serialized the story really is  I won t start a continuous saga that isn t concluded  but anything with defined arcs or with returning characters in otherwise self contained adventures is fine ;1595
1235;2023-05-28 11:59:00;2.0;Sometimes a series is so good  like ASoiaF  that the prospect of it being unfinished  and probably never will  spurs so much interesting discussion to be had that it s not a big deal  Also  if you enjoy rereading for the sake of it  then unfinished or not  it doesn t really matter  Reliving the worlds again  getting caught up in theories and what ifs are also pretty fun   Look at the amount of series one will DNF in the future  I would much rather prefer an unfinished series I reaaaally enjoyed vs a finished series I sunk time into that I couldn t bear to finish ;1546
1236;2023-05-28 23:04:00;2.0;Yes  If the series doesn t get finished I forget about it and move on  Journey before destination ;1714
1237;2023-05-29 22:30:00;2.0;I don t like to  Sadly I recently have because I didn t know and I am so deeply sad about it  All of the author s other books and for the most part stand alone  Same characters but each plot is completed  But her next  to  last book ended with the main character at the most tragic moment of his life    and she was unable to finish the last book  I don t blame her for it   she fell ill and passed away   but the bio I read about her said the final book  and it was too be the final book  didn t have enough information on it like notes or outlines for anyone else to finish    RIP Lillian Jackson Braun  Maybe if we meet in the afterlife you can tell me what happened ;724
1238;2023-05-27 10:53:00;2.0;I also don t like starting series before they re finished  but I tend to buy the books  or at least the first one or two seeing as I mostly read trilogies  so that I m still supporting the author and showing the publisher  I want more of this series  ;922
1239;2023-05-27 12:12:00;2.0;The ASOIAF PTSD in this thread  because same    It s been 12 years    GRRM s case is especially prominent since he publicly waffles about deadlines and how he s doing everything  but  writing  He s also had the show  a whole ass eight seasons  without anything new released on his end  But that hasn t stopped me  Most authors finish their works  I m good to start an unfinished series  especially if there are several books to get immersed in  It brings back a lot of happy memories and nostalgia of waiting for the next Harry Potter book s release ;2128
1240;2023-05-27 16:45:00;2.0;If it s a new series I don t mind reading it  otherwise the second one may never come and it ll be  partially  my fault    If it s an older series  5  years  and the next one is nowhere in sight  I ll usually leave it  Unfortunately I usually don t find out until I ve already started  but if I m on book 1 of 3  I ll finish book 1 and wait for book 3 before reading book 2   Then there s less to recap and I don t waste more time on a series that might never be finished ;712
1241;2023-05-27 16:22:00;2.0;I hate to say that I will read ASOIAF 6 AND KCC 3  I can t just stop  Have I lost all respect for them  Yes  Will I abandon some of the greatest fantasy series to ever be written  Fuck no ;353
1242;2023-05-27 10:53:00;2.0;I kind of like the feeling of reading a book when it comes out and waiting for the next one  It makes it more exciting   Like you  I have trouble remembering some stuff though  I rely on authors having a summary in the next book or at least refreshing my memory in some way   Some series I abandon because I forget too much  For example  Kameron Hurley s series  I enjoyed book one but some time went by before I read book 2 and it didn t include a summary so I had   no idea   what was going on  I didn t really want to reread all of book 1 so    oh well ;1794
1243;2023-05-27 21:48:00;2.0;I hate reading unfinished series but i still do it because i have no self control   I should ve learned from A Song of Ice   Fire but noooooooo;957
1244;2023-05-27 14:59:00;2.0;No  I avoid them  Unless I know a book or partial series  can  be read as a standalone  I m not going to start it  I  hate  it when stories are left unfinished cancelled  The ending has a big influence on my final appreciation of a story  so if there s  potentially  never going to be an ending  which is true for everything unfinished   I d rather just wait ;1741
1245;2023-05-27 20:08:00;2.0;My mindset is that there are so many amazing unfinished series out there  and that if I limit myself to only the finished ones  I could be missing out on some great reads  Although my preference is  of course  for the sagas to be finished  I still find lots of enjoyment in unfinished series ;418
1246;2023-05-27 11:35:00;2.0;What a timely post  I was just debating this  I read part Patrick Rothfuss s Name of the Wind  I had started it last Christmas and out it down  I picked it up again and then was looking at how it s been many years since the last book came out  Yesterday  I decided I wasn t super into the book anyway  My dog also ripped the cover off and chewed a couple pages  I have also read a book sometimes in a series and never finished the series for various reasons  Maybe the first one was good enough but I m just not that interested  it doesn t end on a cliffhanger  or I just move on to something else  I really don t think I would be able to finish a 10 book series without losing interest  There s so many books and only so much time so I m pretty picky ;1579
1247;2023-05-27 12:16:00;2.0;A series being finished is a big plus  but I don t at all regret reading Game of Thrones  Name of the Wind  or the Lies of Locke Lamora    I would certainly have missed out on a  lot of hype and good reading experiences and speculation if I decided to wait with Game of Thrones or Harry Potter back in the days ;1335
1248;2023-05-27 10:56:00;2.0;GRRM meeds to finish Game of Thrones before he dies ;1297
1249;2023-05-27 11:31:00;2.0;A thought  Human beings usually want to see a broad narrative arc that finishes with a satisfying sense of redemption   Without that  we feel cheated  Perhaps it s hardwired into us  ;591
1250;2023-05-28 02:52:00;2.0;I try to avoid unfinished series  Sometimes  though  I ll stumble upon a book that looks good  not knowing it s part of a series  and start to read only to get to a cliffhanger and then the text  Next book in series out in May 2030   made up date   So I ll put it in my calendar with notes about what happened in the first book  Ok  if I m honest  it happens more than sometimes  You think I would learn ;682
1251;2023-05-27 15:46:00;2.0;No   Once burned  twice shy   Patric Rothfuss  GRRM etc   ;1120
1252;2023-05-27 11:36:00;0.0;The problem for me with a never finished series is I believe it violates an implicit promise to the reader    To me  typically if you are only reading a portion of the intended work  you often get only rising action  It s easier to create something if you only have to make rising action  with no thought put to resolution    For example  In the popular TV show Lost  they got viewers hooked by showing something strange and extraordinary  with the tacit agreement that its significance would later be explained  The polar bear appearing on a tropical island was weird and exciting  and because of the typical structure of narrative  the viewer had the expectation that it would be explained later in a satisfying and meaningful way    But instead of ever explaining the polar bear  JJ Abrams instead added new  exciting  shiny mysteries in an endless succession  never really explaining any of them  The final episode then was one of the most unsatisfying moments in television history  and many viewers considered it a fundamental betrayal of the compact between viewer and author    To me  GRRM and Rothfuss created incredible works  but they were only incredible to me with the expectation that they have some kind of meaningful  cohesive ending  Or  barring that  they might have an ending that goes counter to form and simply kills everyone  That  at least  would complete the piece    Failing to complete the series undermines the enjoyment  and I would say value  of the extant novels  It s not compelling or interesting to introduce say a new supernatural foe at the end of a novel if nothing else is ever revealed about them and they never affect the plot ;2160
1253;2023-05-27 13:32:00;1.0;Runelords by David Farland was one of the series that i started while he was writing it  It was so dang good too  Sadly towards the end of the series his son was in a tragic accident and he quit writing on the series  I had the book chaos bound on pre order since 2015 or such  Sadly again  he died last year from a traumatic brain injury from a fall and now the series will never be finished  But that series was so damn good  I go back and re read it sometimes even though i know i can never finish it  I just wish I knew where the man wanted to take the rest of the story ;616
1254;2023-05-27 15:59:00;1.0;I limit myself to how many I can be in the middle of at one time  I want to keep it under 20  but that s not going so well as series that were meant to be finished or books that were meant to be standalones keep get sequels and prequels   I have a tag for that on The StoryGraph to help me keep on track  currently I m in the middle of 24  mainly mystery crime series some of which go on for decades  not totally sure if some are even getting new books  and in many cases I m waiting for the translation from Swedish or Icelandic  again  not even sure in these cases if the publishers are going to bother getting them translated ;2425
1255;2023-05-27 12:13:00;1.0;only accidentally  by the time more books come out I ve forgotten all about the series  if the kindle reminds me I have to read the whole thing all over again and I m usually not that interested ;2316
1256;2023-05-27 17:54:00;1.0;Stephen King fans waited thirty years for The Dark Tower to finish;252
1257;2023-05-27 12:21:00;1.0;Yes  Rothfuss   GRRM are not the norm  Most series are completed ;1096
1258;2023-05-27 13:48:00;1.0;I know no books from unfinished series lol  ;772
1259;2023-05-27 14:27:00;24.0;I was burned by the same gentlemen ;1041
1260;2023-05-27 15:47:00;21.0;Martin and Rothfuss are the exceptions  if we dont read unfinished series then no series would get finished;1827
1261;2023-05-27 15:53:00;5.0;A friend of mine keeps trying to get me to read KKC  but I won t until Rothfuss either publishes the third book or admits it s never coming  I can cope with a series I like going unfinished as long as I know I m not being strung alone waiting for a book that will never come ;2360
1262;2023-05-27 15:59:00;2.0;Those guys don t GAF  I won t buy them if they even come out ;1646
1263;2023-05-27 16:43:00;2.0;I was burned by the same gentlemen ;1956
1264;2023-05-27 18:29:00;1.0;Exactly this  I realised I didn t want to tar the reliable ones  like Fonda  Kuang  and Sanderson  with the same brush  but boy was it a good burn with those two series ;1842
1265;2023-05-27 23:02:00;6.0;Yeah  I ve been reading for a long time and there have been some books that were clearly set up to be series and never got more books  and the authors have gone on record that it was a publishing decision based on sales ;2076
1266;2023-05-28 08:04:00;5.0;People make this argument whenever the topic comes up  but while it s true  hmm  It doesn t resonate with the way I read at all  First of all I very rarely buy books  I get almost everything from the library  Second I don t read that many new releases I generally have better luck finding things I like when there s been time for them to settle a bit  In general I d guess between 5 10  of books I read were published within the last year  So I m not sure my regular reading habits  help authors  regardless  I suppose for people who regularly buy new releases this is a bigger concern ;20
1267;2023-05-29 06:41:00;3.0;You re absolutely right  that s why I m  worried  about not reading those first volumes  Am I preventing upcoming writers from getting bigger ;625
1268;2023-05-29 12:42:00;1.0;Yes  but I m afraid of forgetting about side stories or secondary characters if several years  or even months  go by between books ;977
1269;2023-05-27 12:14:00;1.0;Could I ask you who those authors are ;1020
1270;2023-05-27 12:13:00;2.0;Oh  that s a really good approach  Yep  starting reading that series was a hell of a mistake  now I d have to read again 4 doorstoppers before moving on to the next book  although  as you said  it s unlikely it ll see the light of day  ;1525
1271;2023-05-27 13:33:00;2.0;I advocate reading the first book and stopping there   They get gradually but consistently worse ;775
1272;2023-05-27 17:45:00;1.0;That s the same situation I m in haha;1699
1273;2023-05-28 23:10:00;1.0;Maybe I m a bit of a completionist  as it nags at me when I leave a series unfinished  I know it s not a big deal  buuuut ;1619
1274;2023-05-27 12:22:00;1.0;I ve yet to read the ninth and final book of the Iron Druid series and it s been 5 years since I read the eighth  However  I seem to recall there was a brief summary of the previous books at the beginning of each one ;457
1275;2023-05-27 15:24:00;1.0;Yeah  I basically do the same  I try to steer clear of series that I know will take years to be finished  if ever  and get attracted to those that are comprised of loosely fitted stories  i e  you can read them almost as standalones  ;388
1276;2023-05-27 12:13:00;1.0;Wow  talk about commitment haha;1213
1277;2023-05-27 16:04:00;1.0;I gave up on that one I think after the 2nd book  Carmody did her own narration for the audiobooks and the quality was not good ;2186
1278;2023-05-27 12:15:00;2.0;I didn t know of the existence of Destroyermen  thanks for bringing it up  It seems to be cool ;101
1279;2023-05-27 20:14:00;2.0;That s a good strategy  That way you get to support the author and you can read them all one after the other when you ll have completed the series  Way to go ;736
1280;2023-05-27 13:58:00;1.0;I haven t read it yet  but I ve read some books by Sanderson  Which style did you like the best  his or Jordan s ;322
1281;2023-05-27 14:58:00;2.0;That s a great idea  I see that helping you remember things better down the line  as you ll have put the effort to write down the most important things of the plot  Thanks for the idea and happy reading to you too   ;322
1282;2023-05-28 23:51:00;2.0;Wow  you made me rethink the way I was approaching series so far  food for thought indeed  Thanks for your thoughts on the matter and happy reading   Bonus question  does any recommendation spring to mind ;1967
1283;2023-05-27 19:58:00;1.0;That demonstrates a heck of self control on your part ;1354
1284;2023-05-27 18:30:00;1.0;Yeah  but it implies re reading though  But  on the other hand  if you actually like the series  you might be looking forward to revisit the story ;381
1285;2023-05-27 13:30:00;1.0;And what are you planning on doing  Plowing throw it and see if you remember the story ;421
1286;2023-05-27 12:38:00;1.0;That s a really good approach  The answer I needed ;52
1287;2023-05-27 14:55:00;2.0;Haha I relate so much to this;783
1288;2023-05-27 14:04:00;2.0;You re right  as even though I d love to read the next GoT books  reading the first four ones was a delight ;1904
1289;2023-05-27 11:01:00;1.0;Don t worry  I do the same but without bothering with the notes  That way  when May 2030 comes around I m like  f     ck ;1956
1290;2023-05-27 10:46:00;3.0;Who would be the etcs   Those two are the two everyone points to  but for the most part there arent other big series in those situations   Some may mention the Gentleman bastards  those do at least stand on their own and Lynch has made some progress with novellas planned for release;1714
1291;2023-05-27 13:08:00;5.0;Luckily those kind of stand on their own  Lynch is planning on releasing a novella or two and has at least written a draft of the next novel if not sent it in for editing;950
1292;2023-05-27 21:10:00;1.0;Yeah  when you re right  you re right ;1768
1293;2023-05-28 04:16:00;8.0;Well you re not helping them   I wouldn t say you were personally preventing  you re just one person  but buying their books would help;658
1294;2023-05-28 21:31:00;2.0;Yes  plus you re missing out on some great unfinished series out there  And all for what  A grifter whose books aren t even all that great anyway and a guy whose series is basically pieces from English history and the rest heavily influenced  plagiarised   from another  If you want to know how ASOIAF will likely end  read Memory  Sorrow  Thorn by Tad Williams  Don t give Rothfuss money ;2071
1295;2023-05-28 00:58:00;6.0;Yes that s a problem indeed  Few options to solve that   1  Some few books provide a recap at the start of it  recounting the most important events and characters  2  Reread the last book in the series to catch back up  3  Google a summary of the books so far  For big series like the Stormlight Archive there are lots of primers online to get you up to date again  4  Just jump back in without recapping  This obviously works better with simpler series and not as well for complex ones  Of course  none of these solutions are perfect  Primers are good but not available for all books  Still  I think it s worth it just to be able to experience more books and to not have to wait for multiple years for me series to be finished  It s a tradeoff I m willing to make ;808
1296;2023-05-28 01:10:00;2.0;I just reread the books every couple of years so I can get back into it if George ever releases winds  Though at this point it seems like it will be finished by someone else some years down the line  George doesn t seem up to the task anymore ;1814
1297;2023-05-28 01:21:00;6.0;I d rather read more good books than just continue reading a series because there are more books ;445
1298;2023-05-28 01:10:00;1.0;Then there s the thing where an author writes a complete series  and then comes back a decade or two later to write another sequel  Usually the sequel doesn t work for me as well as the original series  Wizard of Earthsea and Book of Morgaine  for example ;2284
1299;2023-05-28 00:28:00;2.0;Tell me about it  I had to re read the entire series 3 or 4 times because Isobel Carmody only released one book every 5 or so years      ;624
1300;2023-05-28 02:17:00;2.0;Destroyermen is a great series  A lot of fun ;2039
1301;2023-05-28 21:25:00;1.0; That s a good strategy  That way you get to support the author and you can read them all one after the other when you ll have completed the series  Way to go   sad that sometimes the wait is years;182
1302;2023-05-29 05:09:00;2.0;Jordan s is superior in how dense it is with descriptions   And it is his world and vision  so no one can really duplicate the spirit he imbued into the series   I think this is a good example of how an author might want to churn out an entire series  then spend more time editing  re writing  deleting  and polishing it   Tolkien did this  and it shows    But it is a good mass market piece of fantasy that I either do not recommend or pick out specific books in the series for new readers to read ;795
1303;2023-05-29 18:37:00;2.0;I think I might try a read the one previous again  Or see if there are summaries on the internet perhaps  just need to be careful I don t find spoilers ;1723
1304;2023-05-30 07:34:00;1.0;They re by far the most prominent  but not alone   For example   Some fans of J  V  Jones  A Sword of Shadows series have been waiting for the next installment since the last one was released in 2010     Melanie Rawn s Exiles series last hit stores in 1997  but the planned continuation of the series hasn t yet been published     There s always hope though  as you point out with Lynch   For example  Mike Carey  aka M R  Carey  released 5 of the envisioned 6 books in his Felix Castor series from 2006 09  but the finale remained in limbo   But he s finally releasing a novella in July  which I m sure will be enjoyable on it s own and hopefully will help lead to the eventual publication of the last novel ;2185
1305;2023-05-27 10:25:00;2.0;I ll try to correct my behavior from now on  Have a happy reading   ;1149
1306;2023-05-27 09:28:00;1.0;The point 3 is particularly helpful  as I have the first four books of the series and I m waiting to read them until the first arc is finished  But now that you say there are good summaries out there ;2307
1307;2023-05-27 10:02:00;4.0;I m the same way;1525
1308;2023-05-27 09:32:00;0.0;Especially when said book is about problems that are pertinent to our living situation    The two that come to mind are Infinite Jest by DFW and Capitalist Realism by Mark Fisher    There s something about reading a book by someone who didn t make it that makes our predicament feel kind of    hopeless   Like they had a diagnosis of a problem we face  Maybe even the start of a solution     But there was no happy ending for them    Or  worse  acknowledging and confronting the problem just lead them no where in the end anyway   So everything they wrote in the book feels kind of like a dead end    I know that s not the point and this isn t a great way to think about it  but I just can t bring myself to read them for this reason    It s just a very sour feeling ;1213
1309;2023-05-27 10:21:00;6.0;Yeah  I hear you  Why are you seeking out books that you know will make you feel bad ;265
1310;2023-05-27 11:54:00;2.0;I have bipolar disorder  almost entirely depression  and I ve had the very serious kind  Like Wallace  I ve had ECT and take an MAOI  I ve read the portion of IJ where Kate Gompert is hospitalized so many times  and I find comfort in it  People who don t have the disease are incapable is understanding it  As Wallace puts it in IJ   it is a hell for one   Reading about other people s severe depression makes me feel less alone    The suicide doesn t bother me  I know it s the outcome of severe depression that doesn t respond to treatment  Wallace may never have killed himself if he hadn t attempted to switch antidepressants    I think he was back in the psych ward within a couple months of stopping it  ECT had worked before but didn t work when he was in his 40s ;980
1311;2023-05-27 10:51:00;3.0;I mean in my personal opinion your digging way too deep man  Plenty of people have problems  Many people deal with depression  Sadly sometimes they don t make it  It does more for their memory and their ideas to continue propagating their work rather than letting it fade into obscurity  You re doing them a disservice with this ;42
1312;2023-05-27 12:59:00;1.0;Honestly  wouldn t bother me  but I am a naturally chipper individual in the first place so stuff like that kinda just rolls on down my back ;1221
1313;2023-05-27 13:35:00;1.0;I do not think suicide says anything about the author  So it says nothing  Dying by suicide  or attempting suicide is no evidence of exquisite taste or accurate sensitivity or intellect  People commit suicide if they are mentally ill  and sometimes to manipulate others  sorry  it is what it is   it is incidental and does not define their previous work   Somebody commiting suicide does not change their previous work or life ;17
1314;2023-05-28 14:38:00;1.0;I d be more likely to read them  Wasn t expecting some kind of universal neat solution   even if it had been someone who wrote fiction with happy endings  real life does not have any such thing  Try Camus instead or something then maybe come back to it ;244
1315;2023-05-27 11:11:00;1.0;No  Infinite Jest and The Rape of Nanking are two of my favorite books  I feel that great writers live on in the works that they finished ;857
1316;2023-05-27 11:20:00;1.0;You could just as easily argue that authors who live apparently good  happy lives are privileged enough to not take the problems of the world seriously enough and therefore their work must be shallow and unable to address the problems of those who suffer more than they do   Or you can just take an author s work as their work and not devalue it based on the details of their personal life ;1746
1317;2023-05-27 12:17:00;1.0;I get what you re saying   But it s a trade off   On the one hand  they improve mental health by just acknowledging the problems we ve actually got   On the other hand  they killed themselves    so to me no sustainable conclusion;2350
1318;2023-05-27 13:42:00;1.0;it s a tough one bro  A lot of great points there ;523
1319;2023-05-27 13:54:00;2.0;maybe that s right   I always see it vice versa     because I feel like the cultural norm  the hegemony  is tilted in the other way     but anyway  fuck it;839
1320;2023-05-27 14:45:00;1.0;fair play friend  I get that attitude too;278
1321;2023-05-27 18:44:00;2.0;fair play    I know that s the normal response I just can t bring myself to do it   but anyway;2191
1322;2023-05-27 21:35:00;1.0;Nah  I think it s quite individual  can understand why you might not want to  or at least not right now  And I m actively interested in philosophical ideas around suicide  so  that s also just my perspective with not seeing it as taboo or automatically negative in any way  more a bodily autonomy issue and about how someone determines value in life  Reading Mrs Dalloway  knowing that Virginia Woolf was describing her experiences in such uniquely beautiful prose  it was very sad  but also wouldn t have felt I had the right to tell her she was wrong in any way  She understood what was happening to her and she didn t want to go through it again  having read it I understood and respected the descion more really  That might be less the case  and the work be more just painful to read  if a writer had had more options available to them and seemed less clear eyed in making the decision   In her case there are better treatments now available for her condition  The predjudice and oppression towards those with a mental illness  and the participation in that of the mental healthcare system  as she depicts in the novel   hasn t gone anywhere  but at least it s  usually  less openly misogynistic and controlling  with more recourse  Someone having  as an individual  made that descion  doesn t have to make it an answer for everyone for all time ;2308
1323;2023-05-28 12:35:00;4.0;Has anyone else read Grace Cho s memoir   I picked it up thinking it would be more like   Crying in H Mart   with a bit of foodie ism   did I miss something   Also  and because she dove so deeply into schizophrenia and war brides  did anyone who s read like works agree that there is was a correlation there     Is schizophrenia more nature or more  nurture  ;660
1324;2023-05-28 22:43:00;3.0;If you re going to try to understand schizophrenia  the best way to do it is to read something by an actual diagnosed schizophrenic person   Also  the detailed 1 star reviews from the author s brother and sister in law make it pretty clear this particular author pimped out her mom s suffering for money clout  https   www goodreads com book show 56047271 tastes like war;1972
1325;2023-05-27 09:43:00;2.0;Right  so I saw the reviews from the brother and sister in law  which was  er  unnerving  but that s family  right   Also  the brother had a different dad  not that that s an excuse to misrepresent anything  but I just wanted to be open minded   SORRY     Lastly  have you any suggested books written by someone who was clinically diagnosed   THANKS ;2110
1326;2023-05-27 10:46:00;1.0;  We ve Been Too Patient    It s been awhile since I read it  but I think it has stuff by people with schizophrenia diagnoses  I do know it has stuff by people who ve had audio and or visual hallucinations which is the main thing that gets people diagnosed schizophrenic along with being poor ;1993
1327;2023-05-27 09:58:00;2.0;RIGHT    It s all the socio economic bits that folks fail to account for  brilliant  and TYFS  ;31
1328;2023-05-29 03:01:00;0.0;This morning  I woke up with a purpose to clean and arrange my bookshelf  15 minutes into this activity  I got motivated to list down all the books that I have  Opened MS Excel with Amazon opened in a chrome tab  I sat down and listed all the books  kindle and audible versions  included  The total cost came up to be around  65 000   790  and I am in a state of shock     This includes around 150 books  Now I have to try not to buy any books for atleast 2 more years   Have you ever done this  How much is your book collection worth   ;786
1329;2023-05-27 13:21:00;14.0;Pretty much zero  as second hand books have little to no financial value if you try and sell them  Heck  sometimes I can t even give them away to charity shops around here ;1795
1330;2023-05-27 10:01:00;6.0;My TBR piles would have to be over  1000 ;1345
1331;2023-05-27 10:53:00;5.0;The worth is those moments when someone looks at my collection and says that I have good taste ;21
1332;2023-05-27 18:32:00;4.0;Last count I was passing 2000 books ;405
1333;2023-05-27 17:44:00;3.0;I don t want to try and add that up   The amount might scare me  ;805
1334;2023-05-27 13:56:00;3.0;It s great that you have this information for tracking and I suggest you keep a copy of this in the cloud or email it to yourself  Then look at your insurance policy  See if it covers you for purchase value  and depreciated value at that  or replacement value  A rare out of print book that cost  18 99 at the time may cost  50 to replace now  If you were to lose everything in a fire  flood or other disaster  you want to be insured for the replacement value    This happened to me with a collection of books  and other belongings  at work when the place caught on fire  Luckily they had very good replacement value insurance  which was a savior to me and also the school library I worked at that burned to the ground  I got a completely new library collection of books costing about  300 000 to restock the new library ;1992
1335;2023-05-29 04:59:00;2.0;I have over 600 novels on my home shelfs  However my 12 videogame strategy books from 90 s are more a whole lot more ;2048
1336;2023-05-27 18:37:00;2.0;I had the same thought a while back and   I don t want to say how much but I will say that these are the things I ve spent the most on  in order  1  My house 2  My child 3  My education 4  My car 5  My books;1671
1337;2023-05-28 18:12:00;2.0;My early first edition Stephen Kings are probably the only books I have that are worth anything   My TBR list is mostly on my Kindle now and it is mostly comic book trades so they are worth nothing ;2014
1338;2023-05-27 18:36:00;2.0;Zero  I no longer own physical books  Everything is an ebook   In my 20 s I loved bookcases and physical books  That lasted through two movings of house  After that I went digital only and tossed all my books and bookcases   Here I am at 60  and I only read digital  my brother only reads paper  It s a funny world   ;216
1339;2023-05-28 00:46:00;7.0;I buy banned books for my now 2yr old grandson  If the fascists like Trump or DeSantis get in  Those books will be priceless ;2182
1340;2023-05-29 14:14:00;1.0;I have around 300 books  so around  1500;2381
1341;2023-05-29 21:33:00;1.0;Four of my series puts me past  1000 if I rebuy them on Amazon today    It was around 40 books  all of which are hard cover    I have far more than those 40 books  oddly I ve never counted ;1967
1342;2023-05-30 00:52:00;1.0;I ve been keeping track of the amount of money saved the last few years by using the library  and getting ebooks on sale  Comes to just over  1 000 a year  This year looks like it will be  significantly more ;1297
1343;2023-05-30 05:52:00;1.0;now I have more than 150 books  it s about   1000    this is not counting electronic ones  there are more than 300 of them    but who cares about money when it comes to books;1354
1344;2023-06-03 04:36:00;1.0;It depends on whether you define them by initial sale price or now prices  A few of my Doctor Who books can go for  30  especially Alien Bodies  A bunch of the VNAs can go for similar prices  The Discworld Ultimate Companion Dunnmannifestin Edition was originally sold for  150 but the listings I ve found have it at  500  If I had to estimate  I d say my collection is at least  1000  I ve got a lot of books  some of which are rare but most aren t  it all adds up ;789
1345;2023-06-03 21:52:00;1.0;I have some pretty rare books as I collect them  A first edition of the collected works of sir author Conan Doyle  A   illegal and pornographic  copy of Voltaires  candide  and a Dantes inferno with art inserts  can t remember the artist name  that I looked up was worth way more than the 5  I paid for it ;1638
1346;2023-05-29 04:56:00;1.0;I have no idea  I own way too many books it would take forever to figure it out ;1707
1347;2023-05-30 06:07:00;1.0;recently insured my book collection for  30 000    probably a bit of a conservative estimate to replace them  but seemed like a good starting point ;687
1348;2023-05-29 04:58:00;1.0;Depends if they re collectibles from small publishers like Suntup Press  Subterranean Press  etc  which can be worth a lot  I ve got a number of those that  can be worth in excess of  1000 each ;1768
1349;2023-05-30 10:14:00;0.0;My copy of Women and Men by Joseph McElroy is worth about 500 dollars  Additionally  I have some quite rare editions of works by Gaddis  Theroux  Dante  Nabokov and others  As a whole  my collection is priceless ;1177
1350;2023-05-29 05:54:00;4.0;Hey  I meant the cost that you bought them at ;609
1351;2023-05-27 08:34:00;2.0;Damn   What s your read books count ;502

1376;2023-05-27 07:41:00;5.0;When you watch a movie or TV show you can automatically put it into a ballpark of when it was made by seeing the lighting  set Design and effects  The only thing like that capable of dating a book by sight is its cover Design and they will get updated to look new with new additions   Sometimes grab books from the library and notice peculiarities that make me question things  Why does this book about counterinsurgency mention do much about the Greeks but never anything about Afghanistan  and why is he constantly mentioning the French in Vietnam and not the Americans  Look to the copyright date to discover it was written in 1964   Similar things happened when I was reading a book about the CIA and the author mentioned how he remembered the boar war that happened in 1905  I didnt find out the Dave Grossmans on killing was written in the 90s till 3 years after I read it   I ve also had the reverse  expecting a book to be publicly before 2017 for it to mention Tik Tok like Holly Black s book of night or to mention the Corona Virus like 2034   Anybody else have experiences were the books were written way before or way after you originally thought they were  Are there any major words like Covid or Tik Tok that let you know it was definitely written recently  Does the way you pick out what books you read make it so you always know when they were written ;1487
1377;2023-05-27 12:10:00;18.0;Before I start reading a book  I always check when it was first published  I think I d find it disconcerting not having that sort of context  but that s obviously a personal preference ;1087

1380;2023-05-27 22:52:00;4.0;Diet for a Small Planet was a seminal work when it was published  but I just went to a talk with Frances Moore Lappe for the 50 year anniversary  That was wild   Also  not a book  but an anime I m watching mentioned TikTok  which really threw me off  Most of the time they have off brand names like McRonald s or Coco Cola  There s actually  an entire list of them   https   fictionalcompanies fandom com wiki List of fake brands in anime ;895
1381;2023-05-27 10:17:00;8.0;Slightly related but it always throws me for a loop when things are mostly modern but before cellphones or the internet   I was reading a horror suspence novel where a side character is in a park and needs to call someone but it s too late to knock on the door of someone s house to use their phone and I was like  tf just call him   oh shit this was written in  89 ;1672
1382;2023-05-27 14:18:00;3.0;A crown of feathers by Singer  one of my favorite classic short stories  was written in 1973  I thought it was way older;1319
1383;2023-05-27 17:29:00;3.0;One of my fave authors is Marlen Haushofer  Austrian author  I wish she was better known abroad  but unfortunately there aren t that many translations   when I first read a collection of her short stories  I knew nothing of her and I d assumed the stories were from the early 90s  Turns out she died in 1970 and one of the best stories is from 1958  Never would have guessed that  there s this amazing timelessness to her writing  She writes similarly to Shirley Jackson btw  less horror though  more existential dread   who I think also falls in this category ;1859
1384;2023-05-27 17:31:00;3.0;From Missouri   an American Farmer Looks Back by Thad Snow  It s about farming in southeastern Missouri and gets into race relations and racism  He wrote the book in 1954 and is looking back at the 1920s and 30s  I kept forgetting it wasn t about TODAY  He is an erudite thinker and the writing is wonderful and felt entirely modern  As did  unfortunately  many of the events he described ;1392
1385;2023-05-27 22:06:00;2.0;Yeah  I realised that Guards Guards was published in 1989  the same year that Classic Doctor Who finished ;2420

1387;2023-05-28 02:57:00;1.0;I ve read a few books written in the 1950s to 1990s  new editions or ebook editions  so I don t realize how old the book is    It takes me about half the book before I realized they made no mention of computers or cell phones   ;2411
1388;2023-05-28 05:10:00;1.0;For some reason I always think Dracula is far older than it is ;1779
1389;2023-05-28 05:45:00;1.0;I ve been caught the same way  but I generally look at the first published date now   I always do for nonfiction  especially the sciences   The date isn t as important in fiction to me   I m not easily triggered by social issues  but even a decade or two can make or break one in the biological sciences ;874
1390;2023-05-28 21:53:00;1.0;The King in Yellow by Robert Chambers  My copy had a very modern looking cover and I assumed it was a modern book inspired by Lovecraft   It turns out The King in Yellow was written in 1895 and it inspired Lovecraft  who didn t start writing until 1927 ;134
1391;2023-05-29 01:53:00;-3.0;OP is saying   Let me do everything but look at the publishing date of a book to guess when it was written    OP probably writes  literally shaking  three times a day  too ;1387
1392;2023-05-27 09:46:00;63.0;When you embark on a journey to another country or city  do you make it a point to visit their local bookstores or libraries in order to explore their extensive collection of books     I do that quite often and discover interesting book collections  such as encyclopedias or books that I have never heard of before  Many times  when I visit a bustling and noisy big city  it can be overwhelming  but upon entering the city library  it becomes a serene and peaceful environment  The library feels like stepping into another world  an oasis within the city  where you can take a break  relax  and delve into wonderful books Think about it  there are not many places in a city like a library where there is quiet and relaxation     When you travel to another country or city  have you ever been to their bookstore or library to check out their book collection  I found a lot of interesting books by doing that ;1648
1393;2023-05-27 22:07:00;14.0;When I travel  visiting a bookstore  or a few  is a MUST  it is always on my list  First of all  as you pointed out  new books and interesting collections  So different  mostly  from what I m used to see in my local bookstores  Secondly  the atmosphere and interior sometimes fascinate me  It can be either very authentic and cozy  or just very modern and cool with huge bookshelves and all kinds of books  for example  Kinokuniya in Dubai  HUGE bookstore that just has everything  which can sometimes feel overwhelming  but overall it is a treasure place    Among my last favourites are      Shakespeare a Synov   Prague     Bookstore in Narodn  Galerie  Prague  yes  it is a museum store but has an amazing collection of art and children s books     Marga Schoeller B cherstube  Berlin      bookstore in Hamburger Bahnhof  Berlin  another gallery bookstore   These are four bookstores from my last trip that I will revisit for sure ;2060
1394;2023-05-27 22:47:00;8.0;When I visited London  I picked up a penguin clothbound classics from Waterstones Piccadilly as my souvenir ;1256

1396;2023-05-27 12:34:00;6.0;I m American  When I visited the UK I really appreciated the book shops in London and Oxford  I discovered Dorothy Sayers  Terry Pratchett and Laurence Van Der Post and Rumpole of the Bailey that way ;2113
1397;2023-05-27 11:09:00;3.0;When I visited Saratoga Springs  I stepped into the Lyrical Ballad Bookstore  Magical place  had almost every kind of book I could imagine with many antiques ;849
1398;2023-05-28 02:23:00;4.0;When I move somewhere  I m at the library setting up my card within 2 days  Even when I had a 90 day internship I was able to do this    And yes  bookstores are the best  I did a semester abroad in India and bought books in every city I visited from second hand and chain bookstores alike to the extent it was cheaper to mail them home instead of fly ;1058
1399;2023-05-27 13:34:00;3.0;I don t make it a point  but I visited a large bookstore in Beijing and drifted over to the small English book section where I bought a Murakami book   Found it amusing to buy a book in China that was written in Japanese and translated to English   It still contains my boarding pass that I used as a bookmark ;1314
1400;2023-05-27 06:32:00;3.0;Due to limitations around my lifestyle  I don t have many opportunities to travel for extended periods of time  I do  however  take plenty of overnight and two day trips within my region  I live in New England and there are plenty of opportunities within a days drive   Local 2nd hand book shops are some of my favorite places to go when I m visiting a new town  Ive found that theyre often run by a local who has lived in the area for quite awhile  and they re typically treasure troves of information  Oftentimes  I have just as much fun chit chatting with the owner than I do actually looking at their selection  Its also a great way to find regional specific books that don t see wider publication   I get a lot of weird looks when I tell people I m spending the weekend in X town  when from a tourist perspective theres nothing there to see  I really like going to these different towns  The town s that I ve always known about and have probably driven through numerous times  but never had a reason to stop  I like getting breakfast at the hole in the wall little restaurants that only townies go to  I like visiting their post offices and town halls  I like going into their grocery stores and local specialty shops  Pretty much I like getting a glimpse into how my life might be different if I lived a few hours away from where I do now  Ive always wished I could see my home town for the first time again  What would stand out  What would strike me as good or bad  By visiting these places that aren t much different than my situation I feel like I can catch a glimpse of something that I otherwise couldn t  Plus being local to my state region  people don t take me as a  tourist  and are more apt to open up in a way they probably wouldn t to a real outsider ;1846
1401;2023-05-27 10:06:00;2.0;Instantly thought of the Hay on Wye second hand bookshop  Upstairs is non fiction academic books  ground floor is general fiction  but downstairs is the horror crime sci fi thriller section  Its so atmospheric I love it ;2290
1402;2023-05-28 14:13:00;2.0;Whenever I go anywhere in the UK  I always check out local charity shops in the hopes of finding some Doctor Who books  When I was last in Hay on Wye  I bought 24 books over an hour or so ;725
1403;2023-05-28 02:42:00;2.0;I ve just started doing that and am a huge fan  Kyobo in Seoul had a fantastic collection of Korean titles translated into English  and just yesterday I picked up some intriguing titles by French authors at a shop in Amiens ;2163
1404;2023-05-28 10:49:00;2.0;I have quite a few bilingual picture dictionaries from countries I ve visited  as well as translated children s books  Sometimes I use them to study a language  sometimes they just hang out on my shelf  But my favorite is when I have an opportunity to gift them to relatives and friends who have decided to study a language  or to people in the community who are trying to learn English   Sort of off topic  I ve started reading more classics in the past year and would like to start doing more literary travel  like visiting the windmills that inspired Don Quixote or the Ch teau D If from the Count of Monte Cristo ;2175
1405;2023-05-27 04:22:00;2.0;Not quite to check out their book collection  But I m interested in languages  so a souvenir I bring back from almost any foreign trip to somewhere I ve not been before is a  local language    English bilingual dictionary ;2342
1406;2023-05-27 04:17:00;2.0;It is weird people here do not mention language issues   So  no  I do not visit libraries  that would be weird  I would not be able to requisition stuff anyway and likely would not be in a language I read   I visit bookstores particularly if they have english language books or other things  or for the experience  but I am not going to buy or get much from reading the blurb of dunno books in Japanese  or Czech or Arabic or Turkish or whatever  I wish I could  but I do not ;67
1407;2023-05-27 17:18:00;2.0;Like traveling  visiting a bookstore in another city or country will expand your outlook if you let it  At least  that s what I believe  Since I started traveling into adulthood  I have made it a priority to check out different bookstores in the area  I have come across authors and poets I would of not have otherwise known about  A bookstore in a predominately Latino community  fueled my love for Latino authors this year  I don t think this would of happened if I didn t go to that bookstore ;2201
1408;2023-05-27 05:09:00;1.0;The Science Fiction Bokhandeln in Stockholm was incredible  and probably the best bookstore I ve visited while travelling so far  Books in English  Swedish and a very diverse selection of genre fiction  Very cool vibes     If anyone is going to Australia I recommend the Avid Reader in Brisbane or Readings in Melbourne  I go everytime I see friends or move through   Thanks for making this post  Never thought of it as a travel idea before but now have to factor this in  especially public libraries and smaller stores when I go somewhere new   ;1520
1409;2023-05-27 05:09:00;1.0;Even better  I check out small second hand antique shops  Found a few old gems  I think I just like the smell of really old books ;650
1410;2023-05-27 14:26:00;1.0;I picked up a French copy of Around the World in 80 Days when I was in Paris  I can t read French  but it s in a beautiful hardcover and is a lovely souvenir ;2274
1411;2023-05-27 04:14:00;1.0;I love visiting bookstores and grocery stores  no matter where in the world I am lol;384
1412;2023-05-27 17:17:00;1.0;I did a coach tour  driver Dennis was emphatic about the terminology  of New Zealand and the driver was well read  I am a librarian and noticed that his mandatory rest stops were always near a library  if one existed   Always  I took the opportunity to always stop in just to look around  steal ideas  and talk to the staff  Got some great ideas and glad that Dennis did that ;2404
1413;2023-05-27 04:44:00;1.0;I try to  even if I don t always understand the language  I check if they have any interesting books about the city country in a language I know  I look at the book cover designs etc  I love bookstores anywhere  and there are some gorgeous ones out there ;181
1414;2023-05-27 05:15:00;1.0;when i travel abroad I buy the same book in the respective language I visit  it s a great way to visit neighborhoods you might not see ;904
1415;2023-05-27 07:07:00;1.0;I went to one in Buenos Aires  Argentina  It was huge multiple floors filled with books  I wish I would have bought more than one book ;2373
1416;2023-05-27 13:19:00;1.0;I buy at least one book everywhere I travel   It s a wonderful way to capture memories  and the diversity of books acquired is just awesome ;2036
1417;2023-05-27 20:47:00;1.0;I ve worked short term jobs around the country and one of the nice things is that most libraries let you pay for a nonresident card  Not only is it nice for checking out books but they let people with nonresident cards check out DVDs too  Super nice when traveling on a budget and you might not have a TV where you re staying but you ve got a laptop with a DVD player ;35
1418;2023-05-28 21:13:00;1.0;I don t visit libraries so much but I ve never passed a bookstore I haven t visited during my travels  I usually buy a book  too  My favorite so far was a cute little store in Ullapool Scotland  Spouse hung out in a pub having a whiskey while I wandered about the bookstore ;170
1419;2023-05-27 15:46:00;0.0;I used to be a sales rep for a publishing company  so I think I ve visited nearly every University Library in the ANZ region  Some are amazing spaces  others are quite spartan and functional  but on the whole they are digital repositories and co working spaces rather than physical collections  which reflects the relative youth of our nations   while the state Library of Victoria is an amazing building and has some surprising things in it s collection  we don t have huge collections of Illuminated manuscripts  for example   because European settlement only dates to 1788    when I travel internationally it s often for conferences or with my band  so there s usually not a lot of time for sightseeing sadly  Probably the most impressive thing I ve seen is the old Library at Trinity College Dublin   I ve seen the Book of Kells in the flesh which is breathtaking  The Irish national library is pretty great too   when I was there they had all of Yeats manuscripts on display along with a lot of his Magical paraphernalia  I ve seen the Danish  Czech and Hungarian national libraries because I had a day off on the tour itinerary in those cities and made the time to go  When I was a kid my Mother worked at the New Zealand national library so I spent a lot of time there growing up   I try and travel light  and what space I have to bring things home tends to go towards records rather than books  so I don t tend to visit bookshops ;778
1420;2023-05-27 05:18:00;1.0;Fellow New Englander here  do you have any favorite spots for 2nd hand bookshopping ;1253
1421;2023-05-27 09:28:00;2.0;Honestly  the bulk of my books are purchased at goodwill  I mean   1 soft cover and  2 hardcover is pretty hard to beat  As far as like cool places that are worth the drive  I really like the Montague Book Mill in Montague Massachusetts  Lots of unique books and a pretty chill spot to spend the time  Traveler s restaurant in Union Connecticut is awesome  Its pretty much your standard soup  salad  burger and sandwiche joint but with every meal purchased your allowed two books from their library to keep  and they actually have a pretty decent selection  Bear Pond Books in Stowe  Vermont is always worth a visit  Ive found that pretty much all the college towns have some good book stores for both new and used  All the chic little cities like Brattleboro  North Hampton  Portsmouth both of  em  have all had worthwhile shops  especially for titles dealing more with social issues and ideology  Other than that I ve found some pretty cool books at all the little antique places and definitely some keepers down to the Brimfield Flee market  I m up in Essex County  VT so I have to drive south of White River Junction before there s really anything worth going to  But I have been surprised by those random little villages that just happen to have a book store that s open like 3 days a week for 4 hours at a time ;2264

1423;2023-05-27 05:09:00;4.0;I was very excited to read this book  A Ww2 spy novel written by such a prolific author  especially in the historical fiction world  and I just didn t get out of it what I wanted  I felt that book could ve easily been double the length of what it is  I felt details were scarce  and I wasn t truly inside of the story  I did find the book very entertaining  but I felt it just went by too quick     anybody else ;1029
1424;2023-05-27 12:44:00;4.0;Follett was a journeyman thriller writer for many years  He was the Dean Koontz to Frederick Foresyths Stephen King  When he brought out The Pillers of the Earth it was a huge change of direction and quality and everyone had to revise their opinion of him  But I wouldn t recommend his older stuff ;596
1425;2023-05-27 18:35:00;2.0;I started reading Follett a while back  I read a series or two  Then I realized why I no longer liked his books  They are all the same  Same plot  same theme  even the same dialogue  Change the names  change the setting and voila another million books sold ;590
1426;2023-05-27 19:33:00;2.0;It was fine  It s an easy  entertaining page turner  but it s not his most polished work  He was still relatively early in his writing career  and his books got better over time ;829
1427;2023-05-27 06:02:00;1.0;Kent Fillets  That s the problem ;1886
1428;2023-05-27 16:49:00;1.0;i feel like this is a book for a younger audience  or at least thats when its perceived as its best version  i revisited the book later and was not as impressed as i was  when i was a teen  either ;1998
1429;2023-05-27 04:55:00;1.0;Thank you for the warning  There are many WWII spy novels and nonfiction  I hope you find what you are looking for ;2028
1430;2023-05-27 11:01:00;1.0;His books are easy reads  but IMO irritatingly cheap and populist    I read an interview with him years ago where he admitted  i m paraphrasing  that he didn t aim to be a great and acclaimed writer  in other words aim for perfection  but to write in a style and with themes that actually sells books  There are lots of more talented writers than Follett  but they don t write in a way that a large number of readers like    Follet has lots of dedicated readers  But his style is not for everyone ;288
1431;2023-05-27 06:45:00;1.0;This can describe dozens of authors ;1669
1432;2023-05-27 11:39:00;2.0;Yes it can ;705
1433;2023-05-28 02:04:00;312.0;I finished Flowers for Algernon today    As Charlie s writing became more childish  full of grammar and punctuation mistakes  I began to cry  I m a man who hasn t cried in who knows how long  but Charlie visiting Alice again  making her cry and thinking he pulled a Charlie Gordon broke me  When he first dropped an apostrophe  I started to die inside   In my head canon  the experiments move at a fantastic rate and Charlie becomes intelligent again soon after  The only idea that make it easier to bare the tragedy ;585
1434;2023-05-28 09:26:00;64.0;I remember reading this in middle school in the early 80 s for English class  some of my classmates refused to read further when Charlie started degrading ;761
1435;2023-05-28 10:42:00;33.0;It s a heartbreaking book ;1122
1436;2023-05-28 11:12:00;6.0; Stupid science bitch couldn t even make I more smarter  ;2182
1437;2023-06-11 03:55:00;17.0;Yeah  it completely tore my heart out   It s a great book  but I don t know if I d read it again ;652
1438;2023-05-27 13:58:00;15.0;I had to stop a few times because my vision got blurry when he realizes his friends aren t friends hit me the hardest  Then I really stopped liking him for a stretch and wanted him to regress that was of course until it started to happen and that shit broke me again ;526
1439;2023-05-27 16:02:00;4.0;The movie  Charlie 1968  was a really good adaption  too ;1962
1440;2023-05-27 16:17:00;19.0;At the end of all of that  do you believe ignorance is bliss   Not speaking about being ignorant of the book s premise  but the actual concept of that statement ;601
1441;2023-05-27 16:54:00;13.0;My son actually has the condition Charlie does in the book  It s called PKU and if left unregulated  causes severe developmental impairment in the brain due the body s inability to process a certain protein properly    We regulate it so he s absolutely fine and very smart  but it s an everyday for the rest of his life type regulation   I always use discussion of this book to spread awareness of PKU ;289
1442;2023-05-27 20:09:00;8.0;Yeah it is  I read it way too young ;437
1443;2023-05-27 21:13:00;8.0;I big   ugly   unhinged  cried as a teenager reading this book ;1549
1444;2023-05-27 06:47:00;6.0;The flashbacks to his childhood really got me  Haven t read the book for a few years but I distinctly remember a scene in his kitchen where his parents are fighting and young Charlie is about to wet himself  Current day Charlie screaming at his parents to notice young Charlie was heartbreaking ;1486
1445;2023-05-27 22:48:00;7.0;In my mind  I always pair this book with   The Speed of Dark   by Elizabeth Moon   It s not the same story  but wrestles with some similar questions   Both are excellent and both won the Nebula award  1967 versus 2004  ;1819
1446;2023-05-27 22:47:00;3.0; removed ;857
1447;2023-05-28 01:15:00;3.0;I m going to be honest  I didn t read all the comments  My mother has Alzheimer s dementia  I ve often heard of this book in conjunction with her diagnosis  Read or don t read ;1483
1448;2023-05-27 04:53:00;5.0;There is a similar true life book called  Awakenings   Its about victims of the encephalitis lethargica pandemic in the early 20th century  Interesting but heartbreaking story with a lot of parallels to Flowers for Algernon ;1287
1449;2023-05-27 04:36:00;13.0;Just the premise is beautiful  Man playing god and the subsequent outcomes  I am a psychologist and I often think about this  just how genetic testing has advanced and we re moving so quickly towards genetic modification and making genetically perfect babies and removing every defect there exists  Can there ever be a time where we eliminate any abnormalities and how the idea in itself is flawed  Eventually all modifications will lead to other subsequent modifications and nature will take over  somewhere ;1196
1450;2023-05-28 04:16:00;2.0;What a coincidence  I finished it today too  Well yesterday at the time of my writing this   I definitely ugly cried at the end of this book ;722
1451;2023-05-27 18:12:00;3.0;I ve read the short story several times  It s devastating in that form  Does the long form version improve on it  or just prolong the emotional pain ;467
1452;2023-05-30 19:00:00;2.0;Hey u byingling  you were prophetic;745
1453;2023-05-27 17:38:00;2.0;I finally read this last year and was stunned by how moving it is  Why did I wait so long ;1773
1454;2023-05-27 21:11:00;2.0;Oh this book fucks you up if your not prepared ;2380
1455;2023-06-03 20:53:00;2.0;I was 53 when I read it  and I cried   My wife laughed until she saw which book I was reading ;373
1456;2023-05-27 16:19:00;-8.0;Please put some spoiler alerts for others it s on my reading list   ;1130
1457;2023-05-27 17:11:00;0.0;Reading it at 39  I found it boring and predictable  I can understand how it could impact people at a younger age  If you haven t read it since you were young I d discourage a re read    It s the opposite of Proust   which it has been said you should not read until your 40s   whereas Flowers for Algernon should be read in one s youth ;134
1458;2023-05-28 11:42:00;1.0;I read this with one of my high school classes and this was the only story the whole year where I got any kind of emotional reaction haha ;1091
1459;2023-05-27 13:51:00;1.0;I m currently listening to the audiobook and I m DREADING to come to that point  ;1031
1460;2023-05-27 15:00:00;1.0;Yeah  that is a tough one ;136
1461;2023-05-29 00:03:00;1.0;It s one of my favorites  Thought provoking  heart breaking  Taps into the human psychology in such an interesting and very sensitive way  It s on a very short list of books like that for me ;1
1462;2023-05-27 06:48:00;1.0;One of my closest friends gave me this book my senior year of college when I passed my final exam for psychology  It s such a good book ;2120
1463;2023-05-27 07:17:00;1.0;Yeah  it s very sad  Charlie probably dies at the end as well  closest I ve ever been to crying from a book  which isn t very close  but still quite emotional  ;863
1464;2023-05-27 15:07:00;1.0;I read this book when I was twenty something  and wept at the end for at least like half an hour  kept for days on sobbing a bit every time I remembered it ;1328
1465;2023-05-27 15:40:00;1.0;This was heartbreaking but an amazing story  Reminds us that sometimes there isn t a happy ending ;486
1466;2023-05-27 07:01:00;1.0;I m not impaired like Charlie  but I am autistic and I could relate to his alienation  Abuse of kids who are the way Charlie was is all too common and it tears me up inside to be reminded of my school years ;1248
1467;2023-05-28 06:49:00;0.0;I cried reading that book  Heartbreaking is the correct description ;1578
1468;2023-05-30 19:13:00;0.0;It is heartbreaking and such a true warning against rushing new tech or drug innovation ;924
1469;2023-05-27 18:34:00;0.0;I don t cry over books very easily  but this book absolutely broke me ;560
1470;2023-05-27 18:09:00;0.0;I read this in school almost 50 years ago  and it still sits in my memory clearly   By today s perspectives  the novel might be a little too long  the themes a little to obvious  and the style a little maudlin     BUT  The themes are about humanity in many relatable and universal ways  and it s style is emotional because what is being experienced is emotional   It s change into a more logical intelligence simply adds weight to the emotion of memory     And Charlie s regression is what most people  of my own age  fear   To lose what we have gained  over decades  in memory and capabilities    Getting old    Dementia   going from a productive  smart  active member of society  to someone who needs care  again  as if we are children   It hits stereotypes  shamelessly  but stereotypes of the human condition are stereotypes for a reason     they are honest and common   But our society has seen them so much  that we grow a little less sensitive to them   We want more subtly but that s not what the book is about   I loved this book  It tugged at my guts in a way that few ever do  And it still does  almost 50 years later ;1020
1471;2023-05-27 16:24:00;0.0;I still have that book in my library  I also watched the movie they made of it that was just called  Charly  with Cliff Robertson  Cried my freakin eyes out  I also remember reading a story when I was young called  Black Like Me  by John Howard Griffin  It is a true story that amazed and saddened me greatly  Then of course there was  Day of The Dolphin  by Robert Merle that was also made into a movie with George C  Scott  It made me cry for sure when dealing with the ultimate interactions between the humans and the dolphins   And then of course a story that along with the others mentioned  will always be forefront in my mental library    The Old Man and the Sea  by Ernest Hemingway  I actually saw the movie with Spencer Tracey before I read the book  OMG I cried my eyes out  I will just say that it is so engrossing and the ending killed me   So yeah  those are the stories that have a permanent penthouse in my mind      ;118
1472;2023-05-27 23:15:00;0.0;Yes  completely   ;2253
1473;2023-05-27 07:42:00;25.0;In junior high they assigned us this and Jonathan Livingston Seagull   I remember thinking they must have a literal goal of making us depressed   They followed these two up with The Pearl   I quit reading assigned books till college after that ;1621
1474;2023-05-28 06:47:00;2.0;I don t know if I m grateful to have read it in adulthood or if it would of been better reading it in school  Either way  I m grateful to have read it  as it gave me a different perspective ;2104
1475;2023-05-27 17:23:00;1.0;I remember needing to put it down for a moment because it brought tears to my eyes ;1620
1476;2023-05-27 17:24:00;2.0;I haven t read since high school  same with most Steinbeck  I should read it again however  It s wonderfully written  but oh so depressing  Steinbeck is the same apart from  Cannery Row   which brings a lot of light to the depression era with how people not only survived but enjoyed life a bit ;1246
1477;2023-05-28 16:06:00;24.0;Maybe not bliss  but contentment   In Charlie s case he s only distraught after his ignorance of his IQ is dispelled   Knowing how much your life sucks isn t a recipe for happiness ;897
1478;2023-05-30 22:16:00;5.0;It truly is;439
1479;2023-05-27 19:58:00;2.0;Yes  Often people don t know they are unhappy until someone points out how unhappy their situation is ;1650
1480;2023-05-28 11:45:00;8.0;Been years since I ve read the book  so remind me  did they ever actually name his condition  Or how is it you know Charlie has PKU ;714
1481;2023-05-28 01:04:00;2.0;phenylketonuria ;1352
1482;2023-05-27 08:55:00;5.0;I was almost 40 and way too young to read it ;1360
1483;2023-05-27 09:46:00;4.0;I was even slightly more horrified about Algernon  He understood English clearly enough to plot his escape with Charlie at the conference  Imagine being smart enough to know you re a mouse and remember before and know you re going back to it  Unable to speak even though you understand ;2301
1484;2023-05-28 15:53:00;1.0;sorry for late reply  but if you want to get sad and depressed  sure  But it gives good insight onto someone being ruined mentally;932
1485;2023-05-30 22:37:00;3.0;The movie is excellent too  Robert De Niro and Robin Williams ;1009
1486;2023-05-27 20:07:00;5.0;I don t think there s any  playing  involved  We are our own gods and can carry out that role as we see fit ;2153
1487;2023-05-28 02:02:00;1.0;Thank goodness you re a psychologist and not an actual scientist ;1756
1488;2023-05-27 10:39:00;4.0;I have read both  The short story is perfection  the novel feels padded  It didn t give me the same emotional punch ;894
1489;2023-05-27 20:30:00;1.0;Y;22
1490;2023-05-27 20:54:00;1.0;I just read it today   I m also 53  I heard empathy doesn t peak until our 60s ;1997
1491;2023-05-27 22:26:00;7.0;Never even thought of this issue on this sub   Good reminder ;2077
1492;2023-05-27 02:51:00;12.0;If its on your reading list you have heard of it and know the premise of it  It s also first published in 1959  Requesting a spoiler alert for something 60  years old is a bit   ;1748
1493;2023-05-27 07:32:00;8.0;Same   Then they added Catcher in the Rye to that pile    ;1140
1494;2023-05-27 03:13:00;6.0; All Summer in a Day  a short story by Ray Bradbury we had to read in 5th grade  still lives rent free in my head ;1398
1495;2023-05-27 13:52:00;16.0;And they wonder why some kids get so nihilistic and go goth emo at that age ;362
1496;2023-05-27 18:59:00;2.0;My middle school went straight from The Pearl to Flowers for Algernon  Everyone got so angry in my class at some point  but we weren t allowed to discuss why because we were all at different points ;1992
1497;2023-05-27 04:52:00;2.0;That s it ;504
1498;2023-05-27 11:58:00;-5.0;I respectfully disagree  we re not gods  We re mere mortal humans and we re playing with what shouldn t be meddled with  It s also a very clear theme in the book too  We re meddling with what was genetically endowed  And as much as we deem it to carry out that role  nature and by large  God  will take over  And I m not talking about medical procedures in here  I m talking about meddling with genetic modifications here   Charlie was so blissfully unaware of his condition  but his increasing intelligence and then the decline of it  brought him a much higher grief than otherwise ;1292
1499;2023-05-27 18:51:00;1.0;Agreed ;1751
1500;2023-05-27 07:21:00;3.0;FYI our subreddit s spoiler policy is   3 9  If you do not mark your post or comment as having spoilers    no matter how old the book or other piece of media is    it will be removed  Deliberately posting spoilers will result in a ban ;1346
1501;2023-05-27 09:40:00;2.0;I don t know   I stopped reading 10 pages into The Hobbit  saw the movie years later  and am still not sure what it s about   I blank out with boredom every time   Hot take  I know  but my actual point  and I do have one  is that many people don t grow up in an environment where literature is plentiful and there are tons of people who have no idea the plot of many  classic  or well regarded books ;845
1502;2023-05-27 03:48:00;-11.0;You do realize that reddit is filled with people from all over the world  A lot of people from non English speaking countries  mine included  have never even heard of this book at all and most of us haven t been forced to read US UK classics in school because we have our own classics  So all of these books are  new  to us  I read it last year and all I knew about it is that it kept making people cry  because of all the topics about it on reddit  And if they are from a country where this book is well known  not everyone grows up under the same circumstances and have had the opportunity to read it or know about it  It takes almost zero effort to use a spoiler tag and not ruin a book experience for others  So refusing to do the bare minimum  so other can enjoy the book without spoilers is a bit      ;69
1503;2023-05-27 16:15:00;4.0;That was fine  Holden was a dick ;1198
1504;2023-05-27 09:57:00;2.0;Ffs ;1698
1505;2023-05-27 03:24:00;2.0;Same for me with  A Good Man is Hard to Find    7th grade ;1591
1506;2023-05-27 05:35:00;1.0;What is the middle school admin teacher obsession with linking those two  ;1379
1507;2023-05-27 13:29:00;2.0;sorry for it being a bit out the blue  crops up a lot in my studies and was a big focal point early on   I think the awareness stuff has worked or it s a simple disease to learn about  not saying anything abt the impact  just mechanisms of action for it are well known and current management is well documented  like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease   hope your son does well   ;740
1508;2023-05-27 13:45:00;4.0;So a person with Li Fraumeni syndrome shouldn t be able to have their condition cured in the future because you think people shouldn t  meddle  with genetics   And who are you to sentence a person to being  blissfully unaware  of anything  Are you not  playing god  in deciding who is sentenced to ignorance  as apposed to the inverse ;756
1509;2023-05-28 02:34:00;1.0;I was going to post spoilers from the Bible but I feel the joke wouldn t be received well ;1638
1510;2023-05-28 07:44:00;2.0;The Hobbit was unbearable in either form ;174
1511;2023-05-28 19:07:00;15.0;why click on a post named after a book you dont want to be spoiled though   if i see a post about a specific book i just automatically assume people are going to be discussing that book  and it would be stupid to expect everyone in the thread to mark their spoilers;1997
1512;2023-05-27 18:35:00;6.0;I get your point  However  we are on an English subreddit about books where there is a discussion about an English book short story that is 60  years old  Yes  people should be tolerant of others and aware of differences   I just feel that having a go about someone not tagging something so well known in literature circles with spoiler alert when it s so old and on this forum and when the title of the thread isnt spoiling anything  is like asking for spoiler alerts on the titanic movie on a Kate Winslet fan page ;734
1513;2023-05-27 02:53:00;4.0;I completely agree   Extremely unlikeable  and the book was such a downer   A terrible addition to a string of depressing required reading ;868
1514;2023-05-27 04:20:00;1.0;Thank you ;2106
1515;2023-05-27 04:50:00;-6.0;Oh absolutely not  Like I said  conditions are a lot more severe and that s why genetic testing is done  The syndrome you mentioned  Li Fraumeni  it s a rare genetic disorder right  There s no cure for it  And as such that there is a cure for it in future and I hope there is   the cure shouldn t stem from rearranging dna sequences and modifying such genetics  There s also prevention and also if you know that there s a high chance   people should consider the need to procreate vs adopting  Also  Charlie also suffers from PKU   something the USA screens newborns for now  I m not playing god here at all  I m making an educated guess and not choosing to decide how a certain individual lives his life  He wasn t aware of his conditions as very much indicated in the book  His awareness stems from his increasing knowledge  I truly believe that people should get cured of their disorders and diseases and genetic sequencing and imaging plays a huge role in that  But truly what my main concern is  that when we do that we re  meddling  with nature and as humans  our greeds know no boundaries  We will engage in more and more genetic modification until we make  perfect babies   That s what I am against in terms of playing god  which is why I specified medical procedures vs aesthetics ;747
1516;2023-05-27 20:21:00;2.0;Thank you   You are the 1st like minded person on this I have ever encountered ;343
1517;2023-05-27 10:45:00;-6.0;Depending on your settings device  often times the first few sentences already show up on the frontpage  Sometimes you can t help but pick up things when you scroll by  it s happened to me several times as well  and right at the start of this post is pretty much the entire point of the book  I m not saying that everyone who comments needs to use spoiler tags in a spoiler post  I m just saying that the entire post should be marked as a spoiler discussion  A simple spoiler tag on the entire post hides the text and it let s people know that there are spoilers  If it takes pretty much zero effort  one click tap while making the post  and it allows others to avoid spoilers when desired  is it even worth arguing over  I ll never understand why some always seem so excited to ruin things for others just because they ve known about it for years ;1545
1518;2023-05-28 07:10:00;1.0;The only way to cure a genetic condition is through genetic tampering  It s contradictory to say you wish for a cure without utilizing the only possible means for cure    You aren t just observing or making an educated guess  you are choosing for these people to be ignorant  in this hypothetical  You would choose to not allow them to have the capacity to have knowledge because you don t believe in genetic alteration   You seem to have taken the novel as something more than fiction  The opinions expressed in it are worth exploring  but they are just the opinions of an author who does not have any real answers  The character  Charlie  only suffered because the author wrote him as such   And what is evolution if not animals being directed by nature towards perfection  So what is unnatural about our human pursuit of it  Why would you describe that as greed ;1430
1519;2023-05-28 19:10:00;0.0;Human pursuit of perfection cannot stem from genetic modification  This is why there is natural selection  nature choosing to decide what works not humans  we can modify and change ourselves all we want if something needs to happen   it will without humans changing the very core of their own genetic make up  I think my point kind of got lost in this entire debate that we just had  I am pondering over human s need to become god  and playing gods because we aren t  How we change and whether genetic modification should occur doesn t depend on me  my opinions on it are that we shouldn t play with out genetic make up for the sake of it and not for medically necessary ideas  This is what the book brought out for me  I don t think I chose for people to be ignorant  I m saying in the book  his sadness came from the knowledge he acquires and his future lack of   Also  these people  is not a term I use for individuals with disabilities ;1347
1520;2023-06-04 00:55:00;2.0; These people  is the term I used to describe the people you were referencing    I actually rolled my eyes at that absurd attempt at some moral high ground    And yes  you are reiterating your  point  that man should not play god  so I will reiterate mine that there is no god outside of ourselves and that we can do as we  ourselves  deem moral  Your perception of the natural world and its tolerance intolerance for the  unnatural  should not influence the progression of science and medicine  Likewise  you shouldn t use the prospect of that which is natural or unnatural to defend some sense of morality or ethics  There are behaviors in nature that we have naturally evolved past the need to commit and now deem immoral  Nature isn t an objective determinant of morality    Adios;1239
1521;2023-05-27 22:35:00;111.0;I feel like the ending was perfectly telegraphed through the rest of the novel  Maybe my expectations colored this because I ve heard so much disappointment about how the  final showdown  happens but I feel like the entire last third of the book was the final showdown with Flagg recieving L after L until Trashy brought the A Bomb  Wish Larry  Glenn and Ralph didn t have to die but I appreciated their sacrifice  and how confident and at peace theywvere at the end  especially Larry  Great character  Speaking of great characters     Tom Cullen is amazing  I love him to death  That s all there   Ultimately  I feel terrible about Harold  So much potential and I wish that there was a possibility that Harold in some other life could have a second chance    Really happy I finally got around to reading The Stand  The most horrifying part to me is the sequence that flips around to the different survivors and how they all met their end  especially the one about the boy who ends up with a broken leg or legs in a ditch who dies of either exposure or starvation  Shit hit me hard ;419
1522;2023-05-27 22:59:00;56.0;I agree with you about the ending  never understood the hate   The book is wonderful ;1031
1523;2023-05-27 13:58:00;19.0;Stu Redman is one of my favourite fictional heroes  Especially loved the Gary Sinise version ;1882
1524;2023-05-27 04:52:00;31.0;I also just finished The Stand  and I agree  I thought the ending was appropriate  I think the people who complain about it probably haven t read much King  He often forgoes super climactic endings  instead putting the real climax a little before the ending and tapering off  telling us where some of the main characters ended up  I don t hate that ;1326
1525;2023-05-27 05:54:00;3.0;I read The Stand as a teenager  then several times after that  Teenagers are weird  so even though the ending came out of left field for me  though you re right   it IS actually telegraphed  it wasn t a problem   One of the most resonating sections of that book is the one you mentioned  The guy who killed himself because his wife and all his kids were dead  The kid that fell in a well  All the people jail cells like Lloyd  I honestly don t even remember all the actual examples King wrote despite multiple re reads  because every time I would think for hours about who would die in a  second epidemic  if this was real  Anyone requiring insulin  after local pharmacy stock is used expired  A nasty foot infection that goes gangrenous  The appendicitis guy  Those who were already depressed pre apocalypse  People who manage to hunt their own meat but don t know how to process and cook it properly  Anyone who has a stroke   The list just goes on and on ;2289
1526;2023-05-27 13:10:00;4.0;I read the book years ago during college  But I remember one of my favorite characters was Nick Andros ;1780
1527;2023-05-27 13:13:00;21.0;I didn t hate the ending  I think people just find it a bit lazy to do a literal deus ex machina after 1000 pages    And yeah  Harold had a lot of potential  He could ve started the Red Pill movement  grown a neck beard and eventually kicked his feet up on Pelosi s desk  Lol;772
1528;2023-05-27 17:14:00;3.0;The beginning of the book was amazing  the ending was good  it was pages 350 to 750 that were a slog ;1755
1529;2023-05-27 22:57:00;3.0;I agree 100     King wanted a Biblical ending and he delivered one ;2439
1530;2023-05-28 02:55:00;14.0;It s a total cop out  Stephen King tends to back himself in a corner after a great buildup and then pulls something out of his ass to wrap up his grandiose plot  Don t get me wrong   I love Stephen King  but quite a few of his endings are weak ;990
1531;2023-05-27 03:08:00;4.0;Stephen King is notoriously bad at endings   He admits it   His writing process is to spin the tale and just see where it goes  He s very good at that part   But then wrapping it up leans heavily on deus ex machina   I would place the Stand s ending in about the middle among his books  It has an element of deus ex machina  but it s not horrible   Horrible ending from his early books  Christine  Good ending from his early books  The Dead Zone  And I ll close by noting that he handles his non horror endings much much better   See The Body and Shawshank;2308
1532;2023-05-27 04:50:00;7.0;The stand is likely the best ending be ever wrote ;2022
1533;2023-05-27 03:17:00;2.0;Harold is the character that sticks with me the most  Especially as he realized that he could be something different during theColorado cleanup sequence  It would nice for a version of him to loop into the multiverse somehow  I fantasize about  spoiler warning  a dark tower second series where Roland draws him;356
1534;2023-05-27 08:08:00;4.0;The amount of comments insisting the ending of  The Stand  is a weak  cop out  deus ex machina   after OP has literally already explained it in plain terms is a weird flex ;70
1535;2023-05-27 11:22:00;3.0;The ending was awesome;1109
1536;2023-05-27 15:20:00;1.0;Ngl I think I liked Swan Song by Robert McCammon a bit more  Very very similar stories in a lot of ways  and I loved both of them a lot  but there were a few specific scenes that Swan Song just totally got me  That s definitely personal preference though  I also felt like the main antagonist was more interesting in Swan Song personally  Last thing is that     Honestly the ending did not feel super satisfying to me    But I felt the same way about The Stand  Anyway I d highly recommend reading this other book if you liked The Stand  you might also end up liking Swan Song more than I did ;2259
1537;2023-05-27 17:24:00;1.0;1000 pages of buildup to an epic battle and then just a quick rug pull on the powerful villain seemed like a let down  Still my favorite book for the amazing buildup and characters  I also live in Colorado so go through that tunnel and think of it every time    King knows he does cop out endings  He admits it  He even lets his son help him with them now because he knows it s a weak spot    You might like the ending of The Stand  but you might also accept there could have been a better one  A climax that didn t just discard everything about the  battle  between the good and evil humans teased through the whole book  The humans left on purpose by god for this showdown    I ll still read it for the again for the 100th time because man do I love those characters  Gunslinger I will never read again and I really loved those characters  But I reread thousands of pages before the last books and I was so disappointed  Drawing of the Three could be one of my favorite King books ;322
1538;2023-05-27 18:31:00;1.0;I m just not a fan of the literal deus ex machina ;1744
1539;2023-05-27 13:33:00;1.0;It s a deus ex machina  The literal hand of god came down to set off the nuke  If that s not a  I m tired of writing but I have to end this  I don t know what is  I love the book  but the ending does not do it justice ;1906
1540;2023-05-27 16:59:00;1.0;Never found a problem with how it ended  just about the presentation  The book spends a long time getting to that epic finale in Vegas  but when it gets to it  it all feels really rushed   like the story kicks into high gear right at the end  Always got the impression King was a bit sick of writing it and wanted to move on to the next project  It s okay  but maybe a wee bit deflating after so much investment ;528
1541;2023-05-27 06:31:00;1.0;The Stand and On Writing are by far the best Stephen King books  I think Stu is my favourite character  probably because we were in his head the most  I love that SK gave Harold potential to go in either direction  not truly evil or bad  Stephen King s super power is his character creations and development  If I had a bitch about The Stand it would be about the committee sections  they are boring and tedious  I also feel like the Mother Abigail character was not completed properly  It just feels like  okay  can t think of where to take her from here so I ll just kill her off  I reread it during the plague and I feel that even though it was written several decades ago  it seems to be aging well ;675
1542;2023-05-27 16:06:00;0.0;It wasn t awful to me  but I would have preferred an actual big confrontation between Vegas and Boulder  To me it seems like King did know what to do so he just decided to nuke them ;132
1543;2023-05-27 18:51:00;21.0;Now I can move on to The Dark Tower ;1666
1544;2023-05-27 07:23:00;7.0;I haven t yet read a Stephen King book where I was dissatisfied with the ending ;1874
1545;2023-05-27 15:19:00;1.0;they teach that in school  Denouement ;1806
1546;2023-05-27 04:59:00;4.0;Nick is awesome  Resourceful despite his disability  I like the Nick that comes to guide Tom Cullen in his dreams towards the end ;863
1547;2023-05-27 11:27:00;12.0;God meddling in human affairs was a theme from very early in the book  it s not like the ending came out of nowhere  It was an appropriate usage  i think;2141
1548;2023-05-27 15:47:00;1.0;The fact that I haven t picked up the book for months and I m on page 660 maybe this is my sign to read to 750 today ;827
1549;2023-05-28 06:20:00;1.0;I so agree ;1568
1550;2023-05-27 03:27:00;1.0;Spoiler alert     I agree  I just read the book  It didn t dawn on me that the ending was bad per se  but it did strike me that the resolution of the main conflict that was building throughout the novel was a convenient stroke of luck  The title of the book and conflict build up suggests that the forces of good defeat the forces of evil and that it s not an easy fight  but it s ultimately a freak accident and inside job that gets the job done  It IS a cop out  I do like how what Dayna and Nadine do starts Randall on the path toward his undoing but I feel like King just threw the rest together  I liked the book  because of its character development  which is on its own level  I did not like the plot development ;2102
1551;2023-05-27 04:49:00;3.0; Horrible ending from his early books  Christine  Why  I thought it was exactly the frightening end one would expect ;1005
1552;2023-05-27 04:05:00;2.0;I couldn t agree more  and would add that 11 22 63 was fantastic from start to finish  I loved the ending of that book;1705
1553;2023-05-27 03:10:00;1.0;King s strength is in his character development  It s one of the reasons I ve never actually made it through It   not because of the horror  but because there s so  much  background  Usually character development is my thing  which is maybe why I don t mind his endings quite so much ;694
1554;2023-05-27 17:06:00;7.0;I love The Stand but I ll take Pet Sematary or Revival for best ending ;2075
1555;2023-05-27 16:53:00;1.0;Think that must be The Dead Zone;647
1556;2023-05-27 03:36:00;4.0;I just don t agree with them that it s a deus ex machina  I think that s the wrong terminology  Deus ex machinas are usually out of left field and not foreshadowed at all but the idea of  God  as a character was hinted at or very blatant for most of the novel  and deus ex machinas have to be COMPLETELY out of nowhere ;985
1557;2023-05-27 11:25:00;1.0;I have Swan Song on my backlog  r horrorlit has been good to me for these types of recs  I m looking forward to reading it for sure ;1041
1558;2023-05-27 15:10:00;1.0;You basically summed up my thoughts here as well  I have nearly every king book but ehen the final dark tower book came out I totally lost interest in his work   The first 4 books were amazing   the gunslinger was just good though   My parents were divorced and I used to read all weekend at my dads house  I used to read these books 1 2 times a year  I thought the wind through the keyhole was good too to be honest   When I saw he was finishing them off I was so excited  I read them and it was a cringey slog  Either I was older and less impressionable  or it was different and less raw  I disliked the ending    Hugely   but the warning signs were there  Writing himself in as a loveable drunk  including snitches from Harry Potter  it all felt like glossy going through the motions   In the stand I remember thinking the ending was epic  I was a teenager when I read them    Watched the series with my wife and she literally laughed at the ending  She asked me if it was the same in the books and well  it was   The film adaptation of the mist had a better ending than the book in my opinion   Stephen King has fired my imagination for years and I ll always have a soft spot for him  But endings are not his thing  The bigger the book  the more difficult he finds it ;2322
1559;2023-05-27 13:07:00;1.0;This was my sentiment as well  You build up this inevitable fight between a supernatural being and a small group of humans that refuse to acquiesce  Yet somehow  this supernatural being can t control his own orb and goes out like that  No  that s just poor planning writing  The book was great  but the ending was abrupt  lazy  anticlimactic and  quite frankly  did the rest of the book a grave injustice ;46
1560;2023-05-27 15:32:00;3.0;It s only a deus ex machina by definition if it comes completely out of nowhere  though  and God was foreshadowed pretty heavily throughout the rest of the book   Dude even gave away the ending before Stu  Larry  Ralph and Glenn left the Free Zone to go confront Flagg  it s not like we couldn t have seen it coming ;879
1561;2023-05-27 21:15:00;36.0;This may be a controversial statement  but the Wizard and Glass as a standalone work is a top notch piece of fantasy and a personal favorite work of Kings ;1321
1562;2023-05-28 09:36:00;15.0;Long days and pleasant nights  traveler ;1010
1563;2023-05-27 04:45:00;4.0;Lemme know what you think  I love Stephen King but I did not enjoy Dark Tower at all ;1504
1564;2023-05-27 10:59:00;2.0;Enjoy  The ending of the Dark Tower may be divisive  but I think it s probably the best ending I ve ever read ;317
1565;2023-05-27 03:15:00;1.0;But did you read Salem s Lot ;1048
1566;2023-05-27 21:13:00;1.0;For me it s the other first half vs second half debate  The tone of the novel shifts to more fantastical elements and becomes less cohesive the moment it becomes some version of Mad Max surrounding Randal Flagg  It was enjoyable nonetheless since I did finish all 600 pages ;155
1567;2023-05-27 04:46:00;1.0;The DT series also gets some criticism for its ending  but I think it s one of his best  It gets a bit meta near the end but it all comes together beautifully ;752
1568;2023-05-27 15:12:00;1.0;You are in for a TREAT ;504
1569;2023-05-28 02:51:00;3.0;Did you read the Dark Tower series  I was bit disappointed at that ending  I remember finishing and then yelling about it  at King  for 10 minutes or so  LOL;2447
1570;2023-05-27 20:44:00;2.0;I wasn t a fan of the dark tower ending  I get it  but felt there should have been something more defined for such a wild ride ;977
1571;2023-05-28 00:31:00;0.0;I m not a fan of the Mercedes Killer stuff  It seems like he got a paint by numbers killer book idea  I love almost all of King s other work though ;24
1572;2023-05-27 08:12:00;1.0;Don t read Tales from a Buick 8  then ;1438
1573;2023-05-27 15:09:00;1.0;Rose madder;1010
1574;2023-05-27 14:33:00;0.0;Misery s ending was disappointing   One of the rare cases of the movie being better than the book ;1561
1575;2023-05-27 17:30:00;3.0;I do appreciate his mechanic of using mentally challenged folks to be the savior of a given plot  I like his inclusion of people who are often overlooked ;2044
1576;2023-05-27 07:29:00;3.0;True  I more meant of all the books SK might have a shakey ending on  The Stand definitely isn t one of them ;1459
1577;2023-05-27 21:27:00;2.0;Pet Semetary is pinnacle King  Although I don t recommend every King book to every person I meet  I always recommend Pet Semetary ;995
1578;2023-06-01 22:21:00;1.0;I think the issue is compounded by the classic Greek Roman literal and modern fictional interpretations of the phrase  If  in the first instance  it s literally God turning up to help out defeating the devil  I can t see how anyone can be surprised  if it s the second  even more so everything is spelled out in the preceding book  to the point that Stu Redman literally explains it to his companions before the denouement  I think too many readers want or expect a slam bang battle and resent having something they re required to think about ;976
1579;2023-05-27 14:37:00;1.0;The fact that god exists  and is probably working through Mother Abigail is true  That he physically reaches out and explodes a nuke is out of nowhere  If god was going to get literally involved in this fight  why not crush Flagg with his hand in the beginning   King had a plan  it spanned the whole amazing book but in the end he resorted to hand of god  It doesn t take away from the book for me but it was a lazy ending  God works in mysterious ways  except for the end where he just crushes a nuke ;1953
1580;2023-05-27 19:50:00;6.0;I agree 100    It s incredible   I read the whole series and enjoyed it  weird as hell at times  but loved this book in particular   The Stand is my second favorite book of all time ;315
1581;2023-05-27 07:33:00;6.0;My favorite book  in my favorite series  by my favorite writer ;2428
1582;2023-05-28 01:07:00;2.0;The whole series  So good ;672
1583;2023-05-27 17:09:00;2.0;See  I know nothing about the reception for each individual work in the Dark Tower series  mostly generalities  Once we get to Stephen King post car accident off of drugs people tend to think that his DT works suffered as a result ;1806
1584;2023-05-27 03:01:00;1.0;Wind through the key hole is another that holds up well as it s own standalone from the dark tower series ;95
1585;2023-05-27 03:05:00;8.0;M O  O N ;44
1586;2023-05-27 03:00:00;2.0;Agreed  Was a little too all over the place for me  I think I ve made it to  5 but not sure if I ll ever finish it up  Love The Stand though ;2011
1587;2023-05-27 02:36:00;5.0;I was a little disappointed when I read it  but after thinking on it more I realized although it is not the ending I wanted  it is the ending of The Dark Tower ;914
1588;2023-05-27 03:31:00;1.0;Agreed;1257
1589;2023-05-27 04:51:00;1.0;Salem s Lot is my top Stephen King book  I read it once every year ;1197
1590;2023-05-27 03:59:00;2.0;I think he gets that from his time as an educator ;1364
1591;2023-05-27 08:20:00;1.0;Agree with that  I never had any issue with the ending but have heard others criticize it ;2010
1592;2023-05-27 04:08:00;2.0;  If god was going to get literally involved in this fight  why not crush Flagg with his hand in the beginning   Because He required a show of faith  an Old Testament willingness to sacrifice for the good of others  for his followers to make A Stand   Also  He doesn t explode the nuke  he redirects Flagg s fireball into it  taking Flagg s hubris  anger and weakness and turning them against him ;1160
1593;2023-05-27 05:40:00;2.0;I disagree with those people  But it s okay ;1842
1594;2023-05-27 05:59:00;1.0;I just gotta say  buddy  at the veeeeeery end of the Dark Tower series in the laaaaaaast book  there s a little note that says if you liked the ending  don t read this next bit  That next bit is a shotgun slug to the gut ;252
1595;2023-05-27 04:05:00;-1.0;Interesting  Technically this work would have been completed only a few years before the accident  The accident was June 19  1999  hey  nineteen  and W G was published in  97  May have been top of his game ;1563
1596;2023-05-27 02:37:00;3.0;That spells palaver;1246
1597;2023-05-27 05:30:00;6.0;straight face  It was all over the place because there are other worlds than this ;2396
1598;2023-05-27 08:49:00;1.0;I felt that way until I realized it s all his other worlds connected ;1637
1599;2023-05-27 03:11:00;2.0;I really liked how you worded that and it made me think  Thank you   ;2207
1600;2023-05-27 09:28:00;1.0;You should read the 2005 Version if you can  It has 2 short stories related to the novel  a prequel and a sequel I think    extras    https   stephenking com works novel salems lot illustrated edition html;282
1601;2023-05-27 03:10:00;2.0;Hmm I haven t read revival adding to list ;1040
1602;2023-05-27 04:44:00;3.0;Yeah  I always found that take interesting because it s the last 3 Dark Tower books that were my favorite  I read the whole series over the course of a couple of months and I really liked how weird and meta it got ;1065
1603;2023-05-27 09:16:00;3.0;That journey man  I thought there was extreme artistry in the feeling manifested in me with that  ending  King plays our feelings like an orchestra  everything tuned to deliver us to the ultimate empathy  It hits so hard  I read it in my twenties and need to read it again soon  I found it fitting  It s a very King way to do it  Not willing to take the easy way out ;1887
1604;2023-05-27 15:44:00;1.0;Been around 15 years  never went back to read it  All my friends complained about not liking the end so when I got there I decided  nope I m good ;1780
1605;2023-05-27 03:37:00;2.0;Have you read 11 22 63  That s among the best stuff he s ever written ;1475
1606;2023-05-27 06:00:00;3.0;Do ya ken it ;1923
1607;2023-05-27 06:14:00;1.0;Are these the short stories that came out of one or more of his short story collections or are they entirely new and unique ;1226
1608;2023-05-27 03:31:00;1.0;It s excellent ;1876
1609;2023-05-27 05:03:00;1.0;I found Song of Susanna to be very boring  and was disappointed by Mordred  but besides that I liked the series a lot  Drawing of the Three was my favorite  but I think mostly because I love Eddie ;2319
1610;2023-05-27 09:50:00;1.0;Such a brutal end  I hated King for a month after that;84

1612;2023-05-27 13:02:00;1.0;I believe the shorts came out of Skeleton Crew or Night Shift  But there are extra pages that were never before seen as well as a new Introduction by King ;883
1613;2023-05-27 06:58:00;1.0;If you get a chance listen to the audio books  the narrator for Eddie was very well done ;1910
1614;2023-05-27 03:46:00;2935.0;See title  during the pandemic because I was bored and they re really easy to read    It took me about a year and a half  I think  mostly because I took a few long breaks when it started to get stale   A few highlights   1 The Tower Treasure   3 The Secret Of The Old Mill   and  11 While The Clock Ticked are probably my favorites out of the lot  Honorable mentions to  94 Breakdown In Axeblade and  99 Dungeon of Doom if only because they were  very  different   The worst of the bunch was  59 Night of The Werewolf in my opinion  and that one still had some redeeming qualities but it s where the quality started to take a dip  Most of the rest of the bad ones don t really stick out because they were more dull than anything   Edit because I forgot  Would I recommend you do this  No  unless you really enjoy reading generally lifht hearted kids mystery novels or want to see how the series developed over the years ;1709
1615;2023-05-27 06:34:00;1355.0;Oof  Must have been rough having the best three books be in the first 20 and everything else being downhill from there ;1210
1616;2023-05-27 10:20:00;135.0;There were only 101 when I was a kid   Frank W  Dixon was the pen name for a group of authors that wrote the Hardy Boys ;236
1617;2023-05-27 04:21:00;309.0;do you recall what kind of car Chet s jalopy was  ;2214
1618;2023-05-27 04:22:00;461.0;I remember there being a rough transition between the early books and the ones from the eighties  Doesn t Joe s girlfriend get killed in a car bomb or something ;2409
1619;2023-05-27 05:14:00;237.0;I remember liking  13 a lot as a kid  but I can t remember what it was called  The old  blue cover  books really felt like the ones that  counted  to me canonically;1097
1620;2023-05-27 05:30:00;69.0;I was a fan of Alfred Hitchcock and the three investigators ;60
1621;2023-05-27 06:18:00;51.0;TIL there are 190 Hardy Boys books;1049
1622;2023-05-27 10:39:00;49.0;How many times do they get knocked unconscious over 190 books  Those lads have some serious CTE I would think ;1673
1623;2023-05-27 11:49:00;44.0;My first love for reading was the Hardy Boys when I realized reading can be enjoyable  There weren t two hundred of them back then;558
1624;2023-05-27 15:13:00;47.0;I like the one where they get a raging clue;1015
1625;2023-05-27 19:53:00;44.0;I read every one of these when i was in elementary school   In our class we had a themed book report every month and I was counting down the days until mystery month because i knew i had the whole catalog in my pocket    On the first day  the teacher asked me to prep the class for what they had in store lol   People came up to me asking about where to start  doesn t matter   who the best character was  chet of course   what town they lived in  Bayport but i have no idea where that is   is it good  it s my favorite thing in the world      I ll remember that day for the rest of my life  My superpower was that i had read a ton of books in a single genre and nobody  not even the teacher  could fuck with me  I realized what true power really was ;506
1626;2023-05-27 07:48:00;122.0;This is the hard thing about extremely large book collections  especially when it is written by multiple authors     I set my sights on reading all of the Star Wars adult novels   the Youth and comics just don t interest me  I am 3 weeks in and down 14 books at the moment    Unfortunately  other than the books about Darth Bane they feel like they are all just retellings of the same stories  same problems  over and over    I am beginning to see the Sith point of view    someone really needs to get rid of the Jedi ;1609
1627;2023-05-27 04:49:00;33.0;I read the first 100 or so when I was a kid   They are pretty classic ;1373
1628;2023-05-27 03:36:00;18.0;I just checked Wikipedia  and the first 58 books were published by one company  and then for  59 Night of the Werewolf it moved to a new publisher  That would explain the dip in quality right at that point ;604
1629;2023-05-27 04:33:00;17.0;These books taught m what a jalopy is   ;1286
1630;2023-05-27 05:25:00;41.0;I read several of them when I was really young  I remember they always seemed to have a tasty sandwich along the way ;319
1631;2023-05-27 05:29:00;12.0;Read the 42 that were available at my school library in the 70s  We even had a legend of the missing Hardy Boys book that people swore was in the library but no one could find  It was  While The Clock Ticked    Later the librarian found it had fallen behind the bookshelf and there was a waitlist to read it   That one still holds a special place for me  The Tower Treasure was one of the few I owned and I think I read it 20 times or more  It was number 31 in the version I read  Collins Publishers I think  Australia  ;626
1632;2023-05-27 05:58:00;88.0;If anyone is going to do this  I would definitely try to find the original versions  The early books were  cleaned up  a couple of times over the years  and while they are now less offensive  they are also more bland  These were never works of art  but the originals were definitely better than what are currently published ;1481
1633;2023-05-27 07:12:00;13.0;Which book had the swanton bomb ;299
1634;2023-05-27 08:34:00;11.0;Sounds like you re ready to start an overly specific and highly detailed podcast with a mildly snarky cohost who doesn t appreciate the books quite as much but will grow to enjoy the plots and banter ;848
1635;2023-05-27 09:24:00;8.0;You might want to read Leslie McFarlane s  Ghost of the Hardy Boys   1976   where he writes about how he got the job writing the first bunch of books  working from the outlines  how he added his own spin on things  what kinds of critiques he would get on his chapters from the syndicate    more horseplay   and how years later  his own kids saw his copies of all the Hardy Boys books he d written behind a glass case in the living room but didn t know he d written them     Did you read all these books  dad    Read  em  I wrote  em    It s a fascinating autobiography and way to see the books from the other side ;1021
1636;2023-05-27 09:45:00;31.0;Now have the urge to dig out my Trixie Belden books and reread them      been 3 or 4 decades since I read them last   wonder how they hold up   hmmm    ;2365
1637;2023-05-27 10:13:00;11.0;The original 1927 40 run were really well written and entertaining ;1906
1638;2023-05-27 10:33:00;8.0;I loved  The Twisted Claw   the original version   I was a sickly kid and missed a lot of school  and I remember finding that book in a spare bedroom that my grandparents were using mainly for junk storage  It had a cover that any kid raised on afternoon reruns of  Scooby Doo  would love ;1000
1639;2023-05-27 11:10:00;24.0;My favorite as a kid was the one that described everything north of Edmonton as a  howling wilderness  lol;714
1640;2023-05-27 11:22:00;9.0;Always loved reading the old ones when I was a kid  I had a bunch of them  I remember a lot of cases being  It s a ghost  Nope  it was smugglers again   I never cared for the Casefiles books  too edgy ;145
1641;2023-05-27 11:32:00;7.0;Weren t there some collaborations between hardy boys and Nancy drew series too   What an era ;649
1642;2023-05-27 11:40:00;8.0;What a burst of nostalgia  When we were kids  we took multi week road trips across the country  The library would only let us take out 20 books per kid  so I took out 20 Nancy Drew and my brother would take our 20 Hardy Boys  Halfway through the trip  when we finished our own stack  we would switch  Eventually we even got through the Nancy Drew Hardy Boys mashup series too ;1698
1643;2023-05-27 11:59:00;7.0;In a row   Try not to read any Hardy Boys on your way through the parking lot   Serious question  how did they age  in terms of the mysteries   Like  not  exactly  the same kind of book  but I remember old Encyclopedia Brown mysteries that don t work for a modern audience because you the reader are supposed to know that a person who said they went to the bank on a Wednesday is lying because everyone knows banks are closed every Wednesday  which is no longer true ;118
1644;2023-05-27 12:16:00;8.0;If you liked them there s a series by Willard Price  The adventure series  2 boy and thier dad collecting animals for zoo  It s a fun read ;781
1645;2023-05-27 13:24:00;7.0;Dungeon of doom   I think I read that one when I was 10  Wasn t it set up like a dnd campaign ;1291
1646;2023-05-27 14:24:00;6.0;As a kid I read all the Nancy Drew books  transitioned over to Hardy Boys when those ran out  and remember loving how the series sometimes had crossovers ;105
1647;2023-05-27 15:08:00;8.0;I used to do with this with my goosebump and animoprhs book back in the day haha  Sad I lost all of them  I had almost every goosebumps books and used to buy them the day the released  Video games  Nah  books were my thing back when I was 8 10  Now it s games haha but books if they catch my attention at the book store  Depends on cover art and synopsis  Anyone have any good fantasy suggestions ;1259
1648;2023-05-27 04:35:00;15.0;I did this with the yellow hardcover Nancy Drew books as a kid  I think we own over 100  of them  and thats not counting the more recent ones   Congrats  that is a lot of books ;1672
1649;2023-05-27 05:17:00;4.0;Those are not easy to find as audiobooks ;410
1650;2023-05-27 05:50:00;6.0;what about the one where they were playing a crazy taxi   gta type videogame in a tournament in japan or something;2179
1651;2023-05-27 06:06:00;4.0;What were your favorite illustrations   As a kid I couldn t wait to get to the illustrations but would never allow myself to peek   Edit  if anyone wants to chime in feel free;1367
1652;2023-05-27 06:20:00;4.0;My dad gave me a box of all these books when I was a kid  I don t know if he had them all or just most of them  but it was 100   He said they were his and he passed them on to me but if that s true he never read a single one lol  they were all mint condition  I got to around 40ish or so before I burned out and got bored  Found them when we were moving 2 months ago  they re now in the kid s study room on a shelf  I still don t know how many of them I have but it s a lot and they take up quite a bit of space  Idk what the point of this story is but it was a fun journey for me ;1115
1653;2023-05-27 06:21:00;4.0;Dungeon of Doom is the one where they go Larping in an abandoned mine  Also shoutouts to the one where they were desperately trying to stay relevant and the boys uncover a cheating scandal at a video game tournament   I mean it worked  everyone in my 5th grade class read that one  ;2067
1654;2023-05-27 06:25:00;3.0;Try Tom Swift books from the 30 s  40 s  and 50 s if you enjoyed The Hardy Boys ;1352
1655;2023-05-27 07:20:00;4.0;I loved reading when I was a kid  I checked out  The Secret of Skull Mountain  from the library because it sounded so cool    I was right  It was cool and I was hooked on The Hardy Boys   Since I read so many of their books  my parents decided to surprise me by buying the whole Hardy Boy collection for my christmas present  That was no small undertaking for them as we didn t really have much money back then   Since I was kid  I regularly snooped around the house for christmas presents from time to time  and a found more than a few    Well  one day I decided to snoop in my dad s closet  and noticed this these big plastic trash bags  think  Hefty Bags  for when you raked leaves in the yard   That curious   I don t remember seeing them before         so I decided to take a look inside        AND IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL THINGS I VER EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE   The bags were FILLED with Hardy Boy books  I had stumbled on the MOTHERLODE of christmas presents   and christmas was still many months away   It was simply too much for me handle  so I started sneaking in there  taking out one book at a time and reading it in secret  I don t know how many read before christmas   but it was a LOT   I m pretty sure my parents knew that I was sneaking in there and reading the books  but they never said anything  I mean   who wants to tell their kid to stop reading   right   That is a very fond childhood memory ;2418
1656;2023-05-27 07:31:00;3.0;I lived on Pete  Bob  and Jupe when I was 8  I had to get my mom to get them out of the library for me  because the librarian thought they were inappropriate for a girl to read  She tried to steer me towards Nancy Drew instead ;535
1657;2023-05-27 07:50:00;11.0;I have a raging clue;2188
1658;2023-05-27 08:07:00;22.0;I bet each book was giving you a raging clue ;1480
1659;2023-05-27 09:26:00;3.0;I still have my sets of both original and  Casefiles  the new ones  Haven t read them in a minute though ;1062
1660;2023-05-27 10:29:00;3.0;Wow  that s a lot of books  But it sounds really interesting to track how the series  changed over time ;2126
1661;2023-05-27 12:12:00;3.0;Oh man  secret of the old mill was such a banger  Thanks for the nostalgia;231
1662;2023-05-27 13:32:00;3.0;I myself have read around 50 books not sequentially of course in the series but kudos to you  You are remarkable  I found myself getting bored in the process  It kinda gets repetitive  You got a lot of patience ;2216
1663;2023-05-27 13:41:00;3.0;So what happens at the end of the Hardy Boys canon ;1920
1664;2023-05-27 13:41:00;3.0; deleted ;356
1665;2023-05-27 14:41:00;3.0;I enjoyed reading The Hardy Boys when I was around 12 years old  55 years ago   They were one of many examples of positive role models in my world at that time   Other examples were coaches  teachers  camp counselors   really they were everywhere   I wonder if it s the same today    I imagine Hardy Boys storylines had multiple formulas  like  find the missing     or  explain the mystery      What are some others ;1943
1666;2023-05-27 15:02:00;3.0;Oh man the early 2000s memories of me and my dad going to the bookstore every week looking for the ones we didnt have yet  I think we never found a  1 ;395
1667;2023-05-27 15:55:00;3.0;I was reading the Hardy Boys back in the 70s when they were sold in those small blue spined hardcovers  I must have burned through 30 or maybe 40 of them  I loved them  but by age 12 I had moved on because the formulaic nature of them was grating on me ;2206
1668;2023-05-27 16:04:00;3.0;Hey I loved those books in school and have read all the best ones which you ve mentioned   Don t know if you know this but FW Dixon is a pen name for a bunch of writers  all who took turns writing the books  Might explain the differing qualities of all the editions ;201

1671;2023-05-27 19:48:00;3.0;Did you ever get a raging clue ;2326
1672;2023-05-27 22:21:00;3.0;What put me off about these books was that they were largely written by ghostwriters  and not in the sense of Dumas improving Maquet s early drafts of Count of Monte Cristo  they d take the ghostwriter draft and publish as is largely with no improvements  under the pseudonym of Franklin W  Dixon    But if OP had a great time reading all of them  it goes without saying   more power to them ;1406
1673;2023-05-28 08:32:00;3.0;I ve only read one back in grade school  I picked it because it had Bigfoot on the cover and he was definitely a suspect   I was pissed when they proved him innocent because a murdering Bigfoot would have been awesome ;2409
1674;2023-05-27 05:24:00;3.0; Ive got a raging clue right now ;372
1675;2023-05-27 10:16:00;3.0;The first fanfic I ever wrote was a self insert where I hung out with the Hardy Boys  I was about eight years old when I wrote it  Thank goodness the internet was not around in the 1980s because I absolutely would have proudly posted it somewhere and been devastated by any criticism ;895
1676;2023-05-27 15:00:00;3.0;That s some dedication  Brings back great memories  I was more of an Alfred Hitchcock s 3 Investigators  They seemed more accessible at an earlier age  I read every one of them I could get my hands on as a 9 12 year old ;2327

1678;2023-05-27 14:51:00;3.0;Hardy boys was the first book i read in my life  It had a chapter about an improvised tank that i was reading randomly and it made me read the whole novel  Anyways  in my country people dont like reading books and i owe it to that hardy boys novel that opened up this amazing world of book reading for me  Also i live in a very conservative stupid society  if it wasnt for books i wouldnt have ever had the chance to wander beyond the perceptions of my close minded society ;1743
1679;2023-05-27 09:37:00;2.0;Really enjoyed these when I was a kid in the 60s    Do you have a breakdown of when they came out   How recent is  190 ;2266

1683;2023-05-27 05:54:00;2.0;I m probably going to get downvoted for this  but I enjoyed these books more than  classics  like the Scarlet Letter or Jane Eyre;2350
1684;2023-05-27 06:08:00;2.0;I read my dad s entire Hardy Boys collection growing up  I m pretty sure that he and his silblings had them all  I wish my nieces and nephews read as much as I did  They don t seem to care at all about reading books ;183

1686;2023-05-27 06:19:00;2.0;Have you read Tom Swift  I got super hooked on those in the nineties  They were kind of tied in  They were best friends with Tom  I still think about that series a lot ;2003
1687;2023-05-27 06:51:00;2.0;You could up the challenge and read all the Nancy Drew and all the Alfred Hitchcock   I forget the name of his kid mystery books   I know one of the boys is named Jupiter ;1596
1688;2023-05-27 07:11:00;2.0;I tried to read all of the newer Nancy Drew Casefiles a few years ago  I got to about 24 and ground to a screeching halt  I think that s where I stopped when they were being published when I was a kid  too  I read some of the crossovers as well  I still have them in case I want to try again ;2307
1689;2023-05-27 07:12:00;2.0;I quite enjoyed the Nancy drew x Hardy boys super mysteries back then;1061

1694;2023-05-27 08:30:00;2.0;I had no idea there were so many Hardy Boys   I owned the original yellow spine Nancy Drew books in the late 70 s and bought a few of the paperback ones that were coming out in the early 80 s before I moved on ;700
1695;2023-05-27 08:37:00;2.0;Congrats on getting through the series  I read a couple as a kid at my school library but never had access to very many or looked at the series afterwards  but maybe I should give them a chance again ;695

1708;2023-05-27 12:32:00;1.0;totally unrelated to books but Ghostface Killah has a song called  alex  stolen script    and he starts the songs by telling to you to basically relax and listen to his  hardy boys shit  and tells an incredibly graphic story in his raps   if you decide to give it a listen  what do you make of the song ;650
1709;2023-05-27 12:34:00;1.0;I am so sorry ;1871

1713;2023-05-27 12:57:00;1.0;Even the new ones  Every few years  they reboot the series in style and artwork ;2255
1714;2023-05-27 12:59:00;1.0;I was a kid and I ve never been much of a critic  but I enjoyed the Hardy Boys books    I m even got one with Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys working together  I enjoyed that one;1113
1715;2023-05-27 13:13:00;1.0;I have read one Hardy Boys book  it had something to do with space and launching a satellite  but there was a decoy satellite  Read it on a rainy car trip when I was ten or so  It was   fine ;1101
1716;2023-05-27 13:16:00;1.0;I have also been doing this  though am not much more than halfway through  Mine are mostly the rewrites but occasionally I have the originals due to randomness in what eBay supplied   I m planning on doing the Casefiles afterward  but can t find a reasonably priced copy of one of them ;1049
1717;2023-05-27 13:23:00;1.0;I ve been planning on re reading the series because of fond memories from my childhood  It was hard to get them from my library though because of a long queue so I decided to read the Nancy Drew books first   I ve been stuck on book 1 for about 2 months now   I d love to get my hands on an actual complete set of the books  I wish I still had mine  don t recall how many we had ;2227
1718;2023-05-27 13:36:00;1.0;I ve never read any  and I m not American  I m curious to know if people think it would be worth me giving them a try  Or is the nostalgia of having read them at the target age an important part of it    When I ve reread classic children s literature I enjoyed when I was younger  that s definitely been a part of it   ;425
1719;2023-05-27 13:42:00;1.0;I had a bunch of these when I was young  but somewhere down the years we parted company  Used to pick them up in charity shops and rummage sales  but this era book I never see any more   I remember a car bomb  razor wire across a road  cool people on motorbikes  a traitorous surgeon operating on the president    but most of all a room with a disappearing floor  That stuff was amazing when I was young ;412
1720;2023-05-27 13:44:00;1.0;You are one hell of a dedicated reader   I commend you ;1449
1721;2023-05-27 13:51:00;1.0;I read all of them as a kid   I laughed when you referenced  59  as I still remember childhood me hating that one   I still look back on that series fondly ;1578
1722;2023-05-27 13:56:00;1.0;Even the ones about their solo careers  as well as their time as tag team champions ;2407
1723;2023-05-27 14:01:00;1.0;I read a lot of them around 1978 82  I grew up in a pretty small town  so the library didn t have too many available  I d guess I probably read 25 30 of them  When I ran out of them I read Nancy Drew and Bobbsey Twins  I wanted to be a detective in those years  LOL I don t remember any of the stories now though ;1181
1724;2023-05-27 14:21:00;1.0;Damn and I thought reading the 54 Horus Heresy main novels was an achievement   Congratulations ;2240
1725;2023-05-27 14:27:00;1.0;I attempted this in the 80s  as well as Nancy Drew after plowing through Encyclopedia Brown  at the prompting of my mom  It was a futile and frustrating attempt relying on two libraries and the bookmobile  Had to bounce around and my interest waned after a few  even two mentioned above were as attainable as the cup of Christ itself  How did you pull it off  I suppose in this internet era it was way easier  did they ever reprint entire series  I m currently reading Raymond Chandler series  highly recommend ;859
1726;2023-05-27 14:48:00;1.0;Lmao this is awesome  I should go back and read the entire magic tree house series ;855
1727;2023-05-27 14:52:00;1.0;Anyone else remember the crossover book with Tom Swift  The one with the time machine  I loved that book back in the day ;832

1732;2023-05-27 15:31:00;1.0;I still have a bunch of these books  Started trying to collect all the old brown hardcover ones  But  this series seems lost in time  doubt they will ever be worth anything ;1204
1733;2023-05-27 15:35:00;1.0;Oh my God the nostalgia;194
1734;2023-05-27 15:35:00;1.0;I remember really liking one that had a sno cat    I think it was one of the ones from the 80s ;64
1735;2023-05-27 15:44:00;1.0; Thank you for your service  ;46
1736;2023-05-27 15:51:00;1.0;I m a little sad I can t find any  raging clues ;1587
1737;2023-05-27 15:59:00;1.0;I think the Hardy Boys books I read may have been a different series  they came out in the 90 s  but I still think about  Countdown To Terror  frequently ;891
1738;2023-05-27 16:01:00;1.0;I bet you got a major clue after reading all of them ;1493
1739;2023-05-27 16:07:00;1.0;Thanks never heard of them will have a look ;1452
1740;2023-05-27 16:10:00;1.0;They always stopped for burgers or sandwiches before solving the mystery  I definitely remember that;2187
1741;2023-05-27 16:12:00;1.0;I had all the hardback blue covers as a kid and my aunt gave me a few of the older editions  I remember being really annoyed that the pilot died in one book  but then pops up again a few books later like nothing happened    Wow  I m getting some really intense memory feelings about reading those books right that I can t really describe ;2094
1742;2023-05-27 16:16:00;1.0;I read all the original Goosebump novels one summer and it s definitely a challenge to read an entire children s series lol They have their formulas and it can get a bit much after a dozen or so  I found listening to the podcast Welcome to Deadcast helped a lot in enjoying the books for the silly nostalgia they are  RL Stine loves a ranch style home  a bully and a red head lol;1121
1743;2023-05-27 16:16:00;1.0;The Tower Treasure  While the Clock Ticked  and It Happened at Midnight are my faves  I m happy for you to have read them all  though ;2148
1744;2023-05-27 16:17:00;1.0;You re stronger than I am  What about the New Hardy boys  I read the crap out if those in the early 90s ;2312
1745;2023-05-27 16:26:00;1.0;So     What next  ;1342
1746;2023-05-27 16:33:00;1.0;I read them all in 1997      Still some of my favourite books that got me into novels  Going to introduce my son to them soon ;1168
1747;2023-05-27 16:36:00;1.0;Up to 150  huh  My dad had some very old copies of these books  which I read  then got my parents to buy the rest that were written at that time ;361
1748;2023-05-27 16:40:00;1.0;This is awesome  I bow down to you my king  I could never do that myself because I don t like to read and I don t like the feel of paper against my fingertips  But you are the king  make no mistake about that  This was a real allotment and a real  real achievement as well and I just am so proud of you  No cap  it s not easy to read 190 books like that  Give yourself a gold star and a pat on the back  Seriously  nice job ;456
1749;2023-05-27 16:51:00;1.0;Huh I read these when I was about 12  Good kids books ;993
1750;2023-05-27 16:51:00;1.0;That s nice to hear  I loved Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys as a child  and I started reading Nancy Drew a few years ago but stopped as I felt a little silly adding them on my Goodreads lol  Glad to see someone else picking up books from their childhood ;2323
1751;2023-05-27 16:56:00;1.0;I read  and still own  all the original hard covers   I loved the hardy boys as a kid;1621
1752;2023-05-27 16:56:00;1.0;Man  I loved the Hardy boys as a kid ;1321
1753;2023-05-27 17:02:00;1.0;Hardy Boys books were fun as a kid  but I really got a kick from Tom Swift ;189
1754;2023-05-27 17:05:00;1.0;I guess it s better than reading all of the Tom Swift books ;39
1755;2023-05-27 17:12:00;1.0;I remember reading both Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew when I was a kid  My grandmother had entire collections of both and encouraged reading  At that time there were probably 30 of each series    After about 1 2 through each series I got board as it seemed all the stories were the same ;1465
1756;2023-05-27 17:17:00;1.0;I ve read a few hardy boys books myself  I don t remember the numbers  but the  first  one in the few I had was secret of wildcat swamp  then the next few following that  I thought those were decent  I read them all in high school English classes due to mandatory reading times;1923
1757;2023-05-27 17:18:00;1.0;Don hung  But only cause I didn t level him  At all  Level 5 for lyfe get fucked budddyyyyy;213
1758;2023-05-27 17:27:00;1.0;Reminds me of when I read the Conan the Barbarian series  If anyone ever wants to see what inspired  The Eye of Argon    ;1244
1759;2023-05-27 17:47:00;1.0;I loved these as a kid   I think I only got as high as 50 or so ;1770
1760;2023-05-27 18:20:00;1.0;I would have liked to do something similar   BUT it would have been all the Choose Your Own Adventure books   ;2109
1761;2023-05-27 18:24:00;1.0;I had some nancy drew I got more then 20 years ago  Like a newb put them on a shelf in the basement    I will regret that for 20 more years    and probably cry when I finally pull them out to put them in the open top dumpster before I move again ;480
1762;2023-05-27 18:37:00;1.0;I remember really enjoying the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew collabs ;877
1763;2023-05-27 19:08:00;1.0;Discovered Hardy Boys Casefiles books as a kid and loved checking out every one my school library had  Eventually I started ordering them in the mail from the publisher and tearing out the order form in the back to order the next one  Took 6 8 weeks and it was grueling having to wait so long ;841
1764;2023-05-27 19:11:00;1.0;Now do animorphs  or goosebumps  and report back ;1841
1765;2023-05-27 19:14:00;1.0;As a kid I read all books through about 58 for me  One of my last ones was The Vampire Bat mystery   The first 10 books were great  House on the Cliff was a good one   I did find on YouTube someone edited together book 1 as a serialized story on the Original Mickey Mouse Club from late 50s ;896
1766;2023-05-27 19:23:00;1.0;Which editions  The Hardy Boys books have been rewritten and republished more than once ;120
1767;2023-05-27 19:24:00;1.0;I used to read these back in the day  My favorites were the crossovers with Nancy  I don t have any specific recollection of any of the storylines or details though;1237
1768;2023-05-27 19:47:00;1.0;I ve probably read 60 of these books at like age 10 and have the vaguest notion of the plots  I really liked the one with the peregrine falcon;2212
1769;2023-05-27 20:52:00;1.0;I think I read about 150 of them one summer as a kid ;1258
1770;2023-05-27 22:12:00;1.0;I read these as a kid when they came out  I had to stop around   55 because that s all that had been written by then ;694
1771;2023-05-27 06:33:00;1.0;If you get an original printing and a current printing you can easily see how the reading level of the books dropped drastically     Same story  smaller words and larger font and less words    Book version of shrink flatiron ;1736
1772;2023-05-27 14:36:00;1.0;I read a bunch of those as a kid  My mom had read them when she was a kid  and introduced them to me  They are a fun way for a youth to enjoy a lazy summer or weekend  When I read the one in Casefiles where Iola Shaw died  though  I stopped enjoying them  I m not sure why they didn t work for me after that ;2209
1773;2023-05-27 13:44:00;1.0;The first 20 or so are fantastic  Everything else after that is rough ;379
1774;2023-05-27 19:14:00;1.0;I loved these more than Nancy Drew  Growing up in the 70s I would always find Hardy Boys editions from the 50s at garage sales or thrift stores  And then they came out with a TV series starring teen heartthrobs Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy  and I felt like my  secret  favorite was ruined because they didn t fit what was in my head  Such a fun series  nice to see they  sort of  hold up ;376

1778;2023-05-27 12:36:00;1.0;That s so cool  That was goal of mine as a kid and kinda forgot that I never got around to it    What is the publication range of the whole series   Also  is there any concluding overarching narrative arc  at the end of the series or is the last book more or less  just another book  ;1535
1779;2023-05-27 06:37:00;1.0;I feel like I remember a Hardy Boys board game  Or am remembering something completely different ;2189
1780;2023-05-27 09:06:00;1.0;I remember in middle school I got an award for AR points  I remember because I got a whole ass pizza  Hardy boys for sure played a big part  I d read them overnight lol ;452
1781;2023-05-27 12:55:00;1.0;Mentioning the Hardy Boys immediately brought this to mind from Southpark    https   www youtube com watch v  MVAIE3aAxA;402

1783;2023-05-27 15:28:00;1.0;You should read all of Nancy Drew next;2145
1784;2023-05-27 03:51:00;1.0;What s the one where they re looking for a cutlass ;2373
1785;2023-05-27 05:18:00;1.0;I know I read all the Hardy Books books I could find in the local library 25  years ago  I couldn t even begin to guess how many that was at this point  I did enjoy them though ;2097
1786;2023-05-27 02:46:00;1.0;My dad loved these as a kid and still has the whole set ;1846
1787;2023-05-27 15:15:00;1.0;I read them as a kid  really cool  Does anybody know what the books were called where Arthur Hitchcock was also part of the characters  also detective style kids books ;276
1788;2023-05-27 03:39:00;1.0;I collect the old brown Hardy Boys books   The quality dropped  hard  after they started reworking them for  modern sensibilities  and changed friggin  everything about the plots   I won t read the blue ones or anything published after they went blue   My favorite books is the original  Clue in the Embers  despite its many flaws   I think it s just coz Tony Prito is my favorite character in the series and it s where he s most prominent of the brown books ;277
1789;2023-05-27 10:25:00;1.0;Did you read the original 20  or the revised first 20  They were rewritten in the 50 s to bring them into the modern world  And of course while most of the books were written by an underpaid guy living in the middle of nowhere  the Hardy Boys was actually a framework with multiple authors contributing  Specific rules had to be followed and things had to be kept generic enough so that there wasn t an obvious continuity break  And that s why Chet had a different hobby every time  It was in the rules  And that s why the Hardy Boys were almost always on a school break ;855
1790;2023-05-27 07:05:00;1.0;Aren t there over more than 212   https   bookroo com books series the hardy boys the hardy boys;382
1791;2023-05-27 15:12:00;1.0;There s 190 of these  Holy crap  I ve probably only read about 30  I loved them as a young kid and they kickstarted my joy of reading  Kudos to you for doing them all  I might have to dive back in myself ;2139
1792;2023-05-27 04:57:00;1.0;So weird  I haven t read these since I was 9  over 40 years ago  and I completely agree with your choices   Now go read all of the Happy Hollisters books ;2055
1793;2023-05-27 05:36:00;1.0;I ve read a few but I have to admit I know nothing about them  They re the product of a book packaging deal aren t they  Do they have different authors or were the authors mostly consistent  And if the former is the difference in style noticeable between different authors within the series ;1315
1794;2023-05-27 05:34:00;1.0;This takes me back to the 4th grade  where all the boys read Hardy Boys and all the girls read Nancy Drew  and there was a competition to be the first to read them all     I think Tommy Williams was the first boy  and Buffy Miller the first girl ;1367
1795;2023-05-27 06:47:00;1.0;I admire your commitment  I read them as a kid  my grandparent had a set of them  I have no idea how many I read but I loved them    I have a goal to read all 82 perry mason novels  I  have read 3 so far  I expect this to take a decade  And I wouldn t be surprised if I don t  So far the first three held up fairly well  For the 1930s  they were far less mysognistic and racist than I expected ;1685
1796;2023-05-27 18:01:00;1.0;Books generally sucked  and Dungeon of Doom was literally why I had to fight to play D D for like 3 years to convince my parents I wasn t gonna die in a fucking airduct ;1301
1797;2023-05-27 05:42:00;1.0;Which series  There are 3  I have read all 3  And all the Nacy Drews as well as all Tom Swifts and Three Investigators ;1607
1798;2023-05-27 09:19:00;1.0;That s amazing  My brother set out to read all of Nancy Drew series and Trixie Belden series  I don t know if he ever finish them all or not  Our mother had them when she was little but she didn t have all of them so my brother would find them at the library  It was cool  I wasn t that dedicated to these series as he was  but he also did for Hardy boys  but he didn t complete the series  The only series I did set out to read was Elise Dinsmore  That was like 28 books in old English format   Mother had the originals   So I finished them all and suddenly I found myself being able to read old English and was glad about it hahaha ;327
1799;2023-05-27 11:50:00;1.0;They re all about smugglers  Except for the Smugglers of Pirate s Cove  it s about pirates ;804
1800;2023-05-27 14:20:00;1.0;Don t know why but this makes me want to marathon all the Animorph books ;216
1801;2023-05-27 08:16:00;1.0;I read about 50 of them back in the 60 s as a kid  I still have them all  Including the detectives handbook ;1813
1802;2023-05-27 05:33:00;322.0;That s what I was thinking  It would be rough to read 160 books without any really good ones ;941
1803;2023-05-27 10:41:00;32.0;I love the recommendation being  Yeah the first 3 are the best  but if you stick with it it starts getting interesting at book 100 or so  ;2151
1804;2023-05-27 14:23:00;91.0;It got to be a slog after a while  but then I got to 130 140 or so and I started to think  Well I may as well see where it ended up    It also got really satisfying to just finish one in a hour or so  like the book equivalent of short form video  Even the bad ones usually had some excitement as the series went on ;830
1805;2023-05-27 18:40:00;1.0;Every tv show I ve ever watched had most of my favorite episodes in the first season except parks and rec   Doesn t mean the rest is bad always;1070
1806;2023-05-27 19:00:00;168.0; Frank W  Dixon  was originally the  Boys literature  pen name of  Carolyn Keene   which was itself the pen name of Mildred Benson  the most prolific author of young adult mystery fiction of her time  She wrote almost all the Nancy Drew books  and just over half of the Hardy Boys  All the good ones were Mildred s work  the others were of  differing quality  ;1179
1807;2023-05-27 05:19:00;140.0;The paradox of Bayport    Which is located where exactly ;2118
1808;2023-05-27 11:23:00;117.0;Did the authors  I think the series suffered from the same problem as Warrior Cats  where multiple authors working in the same universe without comparing notes enough leads to a lot of conflicting details    I m not simply comparing old and new  Franklin W  Dixon was a shared pen name the whole time  or at least after the first sixteen books  Which  if the theory of one guy writing the first sixteen is true  it becomes pretty obvious why OP s favorites were all in that bunch  ;2115

1815;2023-05-27 05:02:00;383.0;That was the second series  Hardy Boys Casefiles   They were just a bit heavier than the original main series ;1747
1816;2023-05-27 11:16:00;32.0;She was killed off and brought back  that second series was crazy  and I grew to appreciate that one more as I got older;1907
1817;2023-05-27 06:03:00;49.0;Yeah  the older ones were significantly better overall I think    I think so  It wasn t in the series I read  which was the main Mystery Stories  but I vaguely recall that being in one of the books I read as a kid ;2051
1818;2023-05-27 14:10:00;9.0;Some deep childhood recall here    Yes  his girlfriend was killed in an explosion   She was the sister of his best friend  Chet    Her name was Iola;741
1819;2023-05-27 05:52:00;114.0;That ll be The Mark on the Door ;186
1820;2023-05-27 13:24:00;10.0;Lol  I grew up with a mix of the  old  blue cover  books  and the even older brown covers ;1064
1821;2023-05-27 05:16:00;17.0;Yeah  I had the whole hardback collection of the original books  Then found out my mom donated them to the library    I guess it s fine  But still  I was happy to have them all ;895
1822;2023-05-27 05:48:00;2.0;Before the blue books  they were tan with an almost burlap bag look to them   A school library had some  mixed in with the blue books when I was a kid ;1006
1823;2023-05-27 04:54:00;40.0;Their hidden     headquarters that they accessed through the fence was so cool  haha;1795

1825;2023-05-27 04:01:00;15.0;And I thought Hardy Boys was already such a nostalgia blast from the past  I read all Three Investigators  at least all the translated ones  It s weird how crime literature is massive chunk of children s literature  my older boy reads a lot and it s not just the old series like Hardy Boys  Blytons series  Nancy Drew  etc   there are dozens of new ones on top of those ;1795
1826;2023-05-27 17:45:00;14.0;I still am  In Germany they were very popular and even more the radio plays that were based on them  The series  books and radio plays  are still produced just written by German authors  There are over 200 now ;1835
1827;2023-05-27 12:42:00;2.0;Kept looking for this comment ;1469

1832;2023-05-27 07:04:00;9.0;Yes  started reading Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys series back in the 60s  the books were so old  even then  Lived in a small town  I could ride my bike to the library  almost every day ;256

1836;2023-05-27 15:31:00;2.0;I like the Pirates of Smugglers Cove  It s about Smugglers ;1057
1837;2023-05-27 08:39:00;1.0;That s giving ME a clue ;959
1838;2023-05-27 05:14:00;30.0;The relatively modern legends books are where most of the quality books are   The clone wars novels  darth band trilogy  and some of the Fate of the Jedi Legacy of the Force Books  Xwings books are good  but almost like a sub series since they arent force centric  Best ones   RotS novelization   Shatterpoint  Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor  Dark Rendezvous  Labyrinth of Evil  Dark Lord Rise of Vader  There are some other good ones  but those are the hard recommends   Edit  I ve read pretty much every legends book  Have 150  books in storage  There are plenty more books I liked and really enjoy and recommend  But these are the best ones imo;36
1839;2023-05-27 09:21:00;2.0;I ve been using the  Youtini Star Wars Book Reafing Order  https   youtini com list youtini reading order  as a roughy guideline for  which Star Wars book to read next   I haven t followed it exactly because of a combination of personal preference and availability at my library  but so far I ve enjoyed the journey    Worth taking a look at it if you are interested in getting through the series    Note  Lost Stars is listed as a YA novel  but don t sleep on it  I enjoyed it a lot despite not being the target audience  and I typically don t like YA novels  Can t speak for any others though  since I skipped them ;257
1840;2023-05-27 20:01:00;2.0;I haven t read all that many  but the Darth Bane were some of my favorites ;1089

1845;2023-05-27 16:17:00;25.0;Yes  And the food in Enid Blyton s various mystery series always seemed so good  There was nothing I wanted more than to eat ham  eggs and ginger beer while camping unsupervised in a remote cabin ;1445
1846;2023-05-27 05:49:00;21.0;My father still has a bunch of his old hardcover copies of the books at his house  do you recall off the top of your head any examples of edits they ve made over the years  It would be interesting to see if my father s are some of the original versions or not ;2190
1847;2023-05-27 09:42:00;9.0;I have a number of the originals and a lot of the 1950s 1960s rewrites  The first series is definitely more well written despite some politically incorrect jargon here and there  There s more transition between events  back story  imagery  etc  The second series is all action all the time  You ll read ten pages and there will have been three attempts on Frank and Joe s lives in that time span ;201
1848;2023-05-27 05:41:00;6.0;The original ones are better I have all the original Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys books;1553
1849;2023-05-27 08:43:00;6.0;Seconding this  I collect the pre rewrite Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys books and the originals keep all of the dated references and terminologies  It feels like taking a glimpse back in time and you ll get to see things like Nancy complaining about how a  2 bottle of perfume is  soooo  expensive and the cars all have running boards and things  It s an absolute delight ;226
1850;2023-05-27 15:56:00;5.0;Some were totally changed  I read two versions of the disappearing floor  the newer one was just a totally different story with the same name ;1767

1857;2023-05-27 05:21:00;3.0;They hold up really well  I ve read the first couple a ton  but most of the others only once or twice  even though I own the first 37  I m due for a reread of them all myself ;2433

1866;2023-05-27 18:17:00;3.0;I read all of these except Tiger Adventure which was always  forthcoming  but never appeared at our library  By the time it did I guess I d lost interest  And yet years later these books were a huge part of my desire to travel to Africa which I fulfilled in my 20s ;666

1888;2023-05-27 17:29:00;43.0;Interesting  I loved Nancy Drew as a kid but I always figured Carolyn Keene was a pen name for a bunch of authors  not one person  That s crazy how much she wrote ;1213
1889;2023-05-27 07:58:00;27.0;I m mad at child me for thinking Nancy Drew was for girls  I read the first one after binging all the Hardy Boys books and didn t give it a fair shake ;2127

1897;2023-05-27 13:42:00;7.0;If I recall correctly  the versions of the older books currently in print were heavily rewritten  primarily for the laudable purpose of removing racial and ethnic prejudice  but for some reason they also watered down the vocabulary and dulled down the prose style   This was rather long ago  c  1960  so the originals have been out of circulation for some time ;2288

1934;2023-05-27 10:43:00;37.0;  Xwings books are good  but almost like a sub series since they arent force centric  And this is one of the reasons they were  awesome     Much as Mando and Andor have proven  Star Wars is plenty of fun without the space wizards   Han Solo was always cooler than Luke Skywalker  Let  em pop up now and again for ratings  but the galaxy is full of normal people  human or otherwise  trying to survive  and their stories are much more interesting ;464

1937;2023-05-27 08:35:00;8.0;I think it really depends on which part of Star Wars lore you got deep into  It s the usual problem with a franchise of media all written by different people over the course of several decades  Opinions differ  so portrayals differ  to such an extent that some of the books directly contradict each other  part of the reason Disney gave up and said none of it was canon   Some books might portray the Jedi in a good light  while others focus more on their flaws  The reality  as always  is somewhere in between the two extremes  Generally they re just trying their best to be good people and sometimes falling short   Certainly doesn t help that George Lucas had some weird opinions about feelings and stoicism which caused him to make some weird choices in the prequels regarding the Jedi  and then  The Last Jedi  was even weirder ;2413

2043;2023-05-27 14:30:00;12.0;Yeah  agree  they were so much more interesting  inventive  and rebellious  The Hardy Boys always had the implicit trust of adults in their lives  There was less of a risk in their adventures ;1692
2044;2023-05-27 14:25:00;3.0;His more recent Thrawn trilogy is alright too  I don t really care for the story as much  but the POV thoughts you get from Thrawn himself are really cool   There was also a comic series detailing Thrawn s original encounter with Imperial soldiers  that went about as well for the Imperials as you would think   Basically  can t get enough Thrawn  However  it s probably impossible to live up to the idealized uhh   perfection    of what I thought about the original 1990 s trilogy as I was reading it as a teen   Found an original hardcover set  think i ll give it to my nephew ;1113

2085;2023-05-27 13:07:00;5.0;Well it started as a CBS project  got sold to NBC  then dropped to CW  which usually means  development hell  when it bounces around like that  Typically that signals the studios couldn t get anyone good to sign on and so it ends up at a lower studio who signs no names for cheap who are looking to catch their break    Not really the recipe for success ;1290

2092;2023-05-27 13:05:00;10.0;Of course the ratings would be worse because it s the CW and they wouldn t even have the Nancy Drew name to promote it  Even good non superhero shoes on the CW good terrible ratings;86

2099;2023-05-27 13:58:00;2.0;This is my note of a book called  The Pathless Path  by Paul Millerd  It was talked about by Ali Abdaal      interesting quotes make us rethink the traditional path        The ease of having an ambition is that it can be explained to others  the very disease of ambition is that it can be so easily explained to others     David Whyte        With so many options it can be tempting to pick a path that offers certainty rather than doing the harder work of figuring out what we really want    Paul Millerd        The desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same things    Alan Watts  Zen Philosopher        Instead of thinking about what you want to do with your life  you default to the options most admired by your peers     Paul Millerd        The educated  hardworking masses are still doing what they re told  but they re no longer getting what they deserve     Seth Godin        Many people will override their own desires to meet the perceived expectations of others     Paul Millerd        For example  in Taipei  people in the previous generation were able to purchase property with only a couple of years of savings from an average job  Now Taipei is home to one of the highest price to rent ratios in the world  and this same goal can take more than twenty years and for many  it is simply impossible  While the economic situation has changed radically  many young people orient their lives towards this same goal     Paul Millerd       Your intuition is wrong  97  of people think  A person is successful if they have followed their interests and talents to become the best they can be at what they care about most   according to research        Having previous impressive credentials can open doors  BUT it hasn t translated into a high income for the author  especially  with some of the more creative things he s done like writing or online courses        Targeting a mass audience is the traditional default  path of thinking        Riding a ladder the pathless path means accepting that you might not know what you are doing and you might look like a fool        What to do       Figure out what you have to offer  Ask a few close friends  When have you seen me at my best self         Disconnect yourself from traditional work for a bit like 1 month        Be patient   Thanks for reading and let s discuss it ;1328

2106;2023-05-27 09:42:00;5.0;Hello fellow bookworms           I ve recently found myself standing  or rather scrolling  in the proverbial library of literature  wondering how we  as readers  navigate our path to the next great story  When faced with an ocean of options  how do we decide which book to dive into         Is it a recommendation from a trusted friend  whose taste in books mirrors our own  Or perhaps it s the seductive pull of a familiar author  their name acting as a beacon of quality amidst a sea of uncertainty  Could it be the lure of a captivating cover that calls out to us  or a beguiling blurb that teases just enough of the tale to make it irresistible         On the other hand  there are those of us who rely on the curated guidance of specialized websites and book clubs  With their tailored lists  they serve as our literary lighthouse  guiding us to our next reading adventure         And let s not forget the compelling power of awards and bestseller lists  The promise of a critically acclaimed page turner can often be too enticing to ignore         With the diversity of reading preferences within this community  I m eager to hear your personal process  How do you choose your next book  What compels you to pick up one title over another  Are there particular recommendations or sources you swear by         Feel free to share your methods  your go to resources  or any stories about how you stumbled upon your favorite book  Let s create a conversation that could help us discover our next literary love         Looking forward to your responses  and happy reading to all            P S  No spoilers  please    ;1663
2107;2023-05-27 01:21:00;9.0;I m trying to read all my own books right because I have a lot unread  Basically I grab five or six that sounds good based on my mood or my interests lately  Then I start reading a little of each one by one until one grabs my attention   sucks me in  Usually works    If you re asking how I pick out books to buy or lend  I tend to just pick up recommendations wherever on the internet  I have an Instagram that I use mostly for book related things   I follow lots of book accounts there so lots of recs  Also like using TVTropes for specific things like I wanted a gentleman thief character so I went off one they mentioned   it ended up being a favorite of mine ;348
2108;2023-05-27 03:35:00;7.0;At the beginning of this year  I wrote the titles of 30 books I have on my shelf on scraps of paper and put them in a jar  If I m not sure what I want to read next  I randomly pick out a scrap ;1261

2110;2023-05-27 00:25:00;3.0;Typically I disregard anything in the same genre as the two previous books I ve read  Then it comes down to a choice between books I ve been meaning to read for a while and books I m most excited about and how I m feeling regarding complexity  Then it s a bit of a coin flip between what s left on the short list ;412
2111;2023-05-27 00:18:00;2.0;One of the things I love about reading is the sporadic nature of how I find books  Sometimes I ll just go off feeling based on a cover design when I m in a bookshop  I have a few social media accounts that always have good recommendations as well as the new York times book review  And then there s just general hype  I recently learned Scorsese made a movie of killers of the flower moon and now I m like oh gotta read that before it comes out ;1044
2112;2023-05-27 04:00:00;1.0;Often the media I m consuming connects to the next thing  Joscha Bach blew me away on Lex Fridman  and he suggest G del  Escher  Bach  An Eternal Golden Braid    So i ll read that this summer  Also i ve found so much freedom and self discovery in Jung s stuff  so I m reading Man and his Symbols  This brought me to William Blake  which in turn made me revisit Huxley  doors of perception  which I discovered he wrote Island as a balance to BNW  which is more popular    Also i took a philosophy class and i was really inspired with Galileo s conviction toward pursuing the truth  even dying for it  and the material we read in class suggested the biography by Reston Jr  Also a lot of poetry is interconnected  people finding inspiration from one poet to another  and all the movements you can explore  I like to read poetry the most because it s so short and each one makes you see the world in a completely new way  Im reading the art of drowning but never in the bath because that s just tempting god    Lastly i read a lot of the seminal texts before my next classes so i can be extra insufferable in class and i hope if i gain the teacher s respect my childhood abandonment issues will finally go away this time ;1819
2113;2023-05-27 17:06:00;1.0;For many years I primarily read nonfiction for my work  I retired recently and finally have a lot more time to read  but as you mention there are so many choices  I like to join or create challenges or set goals  this helps me narrow down options    I m not looking for the next  great  story  I m just exploring  I almost exclusively use my library and read in all formats    Last year my theme was exploration  I wanted to sample a wide variety of genres  eras  authors  etc  to get a feel for what is out there these days  I created my own challenge  I selected 6 fiction and 6 nonfiction genres topics with the goal of reading 2 books from each  I also joined an online book club with a Genre of the Month Challenge  Each month we would get a new genre and 4 prompts to complete  Since I had to choose and read the books within that month  I wasn t able to get popular or recent releases in time to read them so I just read what was currently available from my library  which added an interesting element to my choices  I met my goal and completed all 4 prompts for 12 months and I learned a lot about what I like and how to interpret book descriptions  I also learned not to discount an entire genre  there are so many subgenres that I was even able to find some romance books that I enjoyed    This year my theme is international authors  After reading about people who were reading the world I decided to create a challenge for myself  Some people choose to read books set in each country  but I decided to read fiction and nonfiction books by authors from 195 countries  This will be a total of 390 books and I expect it to take me 5 7 years to complete    I also read other books in between my international books  I have a perpetual list of books that I keep  I add anything that looks interesting as I m scrolling through this or other book subs or in a store  Once a month I load up my library queue and I choose books from international authors and my perpetual list  I then just read what becomes available next ;1536
2114;2023-05-28 12:58:00;1.0;I use r suggestmeabook and r fantasy   I also have used book store staff recommendations ;148
2115;2023-05-27 04:24:00;1.0;I try to alternate between SF fantasy and other stuff  Otherwise  I tend to read too much SF fantasy  Within that restriction  I try to keep things varied and balanced  If the last SF fantasy book was funny  I ll try for a serious one  If the last was on the light side  I ll try for a dense one  Those are far from the only adjectives I try to balance it just depends upon the book  The  other stuff   it s more about the variety  I ve been reading kind of heavily on the history lately  though  I need to figure out a method for reading more books that aren t intended to be read at once so much  Like parenting or weightlifting books   For the specific book  I try to read books that I own  because that s the reason I bought those books  Kind of a waste carrying them across literal oceans and decades if I never get around to reading them  Waste of money  too  But  sometimes there s a book I hear about that just really interests me  Maybe from a friend or some other media  Sometimes referenced in another book  I recently read a biography because a fictional version of the person was a character in an SF novel  For non fiction  it s probably going to be a topic that I m particularly curious about interested in   Of course  there are also the books I read for book discussions ;2307
2116;2023-05-27 00:12:00;1.0;Honestly  i have a large tbr pile that consists mostly of online recommendations and banned books  I just pick one that matches my current vibe ;1467
2117;2023-05-26 22:26:00;1.0;I add to my list of books to read from online or weekly newspapers recommendations  or from bookish podcasts ;1035
2118;2023-05-28 12:58:00;1.0;Fixate on what i am into and sometimes it gets weird   Currently into ww1 stories written by soldiers in the time of the war  Ended up with The Good Soldier by Ford Maddox Ford  he was involved in the war  book is called soldier  and released in 1915   Never would have read it otherwise and completely not expected  but fucking excellent    Variety exists all over the place;673
2119;2023-05-26 21:40:00;1.0;I mainly use Libby and my library s hold list to randomly  decide  what my next book will be  I only check out one book at a time  I also have a dozen books at home waiting to be read and I ll choose one of those if a library book isn t available when I finish a book ;2228
2120;2023-05-27 03:05:00;1.0;A bit of everything  Recommendations on the internet  seeing something interesting in a bookshop  a familiar author  These days it s my pile of books that haven t been read yet ;861
2121;2023-05-27 02:03:00;1.0; If I start reading a book written by XYZ author  I ll continue to delve into their subsequent works in order to better understand their writing style and how they articulate their thoughts consistently across different books ;1499

2123;2023-05-27 15:07:00;1.0; Sometimes I have to start a few books to figure out what I really want to read  Sometimes it s a podcast  TV show  or documentary  Sometimes it s the weather  I live in the American South and in the summer I like southern books that make you feel the sticky heat just by reading ;91
2124;2023-05-27 19:21:00;1.0;In addition to Goodreads  I keep an alphabetized TBR Google Doc that I add to constantly  recommendations from friends  family  GoodReads  bookstore finds  NPR  NYTimes   It s organized into fiction and nonfiction  I have a dorky little system of notating which library I can get each book from  if it s e book or regular  or if I d have to buy it  Since I read 95  of the time from the library  I often have several books checked out at one time and an idea of what I need to get through   I consistently oscillate between nonfiction and fiction  Often after a nonfiction book  I want some time to digest the material  and fiction provides a lighter alternative in the meantime  My mood and what I ve just read also generally informs what I reach for next    At the end of each year  I love going through the NYTime s annual roundup and adding to my TBR list  That s always a fun way to plump up the recommendations in my list ;1135

2129;2023-05-27 19:19:00;1.0;So the ending left me wanting   something   I had a theory brewing through the back half of the book that was never confirmed nor denied  Brother Charles McGarry is the father of Keira s baby    Evidence      1  The mere presence of the McGarrys  and specifically young Charles  is an obvious Chekhov s gun   There is no real reason for him to keep popping up in the story  and the fact that he has a healthy baby boy with his wife is a reminder to the reader that this guy    gets after it      2  Brother Charles making house calls  especially with no one home besides Keira  is    odd   Grisham clearly has no qualms about showing the ugly underbelly of American institutions  the court system  law enforcement   so why should the clergy be any different   Brother Charles is new  doesn t know what he s doing  has a pregnant wife and is human    it might not have been force able  but he tried to reach Keira on an intimate level and gave in to his human weakness      3 The time matches up   If Brother Charles sowed his seed that late night in December  that lines up with Keira s due date  her knowledge of probably being pregnant the night Stu was killed  etc      4 Stu s idea to look at Keira seemed novel in the first chapter   If this was a true first parent perspective on his thought process  it does not seem like the sort of thing he would think of as an afterthought   The physical verbal emotional abuse was 100  happening    maybe the sexual abuse was embellished      5 Juror Carpenter calling out the ugliness we all know exists  Teenagers lie to get out of trouble   Teenagers growing up in trauma are not 100  innocent      6 Stu was the perfect patsy   He deserved everything he got for what he did to Josie and the family   but maybe the last straw to finally off him was to blame him for Keira s pregnancy  get Charles off the hook  and get him out of the Gambles  lives    No blood test  the adoption closed    not saying the Brigances knew anything  but it could be the byproduct of a cover up initiated by the Gambles ;535
2130;2023-05-27 08:47:00;7.0;This book has one of the best premises I have come across so far but it s just so shitty it makes me frustrated  I saw the film first and I was pretty disappointed with it especially because I usually love Luca Guadagnino s films  I figured he might have been outside of his comfort zone and I read online that the book is very different so I gave it a shot  Besides the first 3 chapters which I thought were pretty good it s a hot mess ;1771
2131;2023-05-27 13:38:00;3.0;I found the movie to be pretty average  The cinematography  colour theme and the acting were the only redeeming facets for me  The story just doesn t have a lot going on  It s so repetitive and gets annoying at some point  Not even gonna try reading the book ;1310
2132;2023-05-26 20:45:00;2.0;I watched the movie the other night  I liked the first two thirds  but the ending was a letdown  Good to see that I don t have to invest in the book  And you made me chuckle at that a o comparison because yeah  I honestly wouldn t completely surprised if that s what this started out as ;722
2133;2023-05-26 22:06:00;2.0;That would not be a problem for me  I m the type of person who would read the same book 3 times in a row if I like it  It s just that for starters the screenplay made more sense logically in a lot of ways  The book is riddled with plotline decisions that just don t feel as right to me  One spoiler free example would be that Maren was raised by her mother in the book  When I watched the film I thought that her being raised by her father made so much more sense since she wasn t supposed to be very girly  I also thought that the mommy issues were better than the overdone daddy issues in the book  In the film she searched for her mother because she wanted to know more about herself and her family  because she needed a menthor  However in the book she searches for her father because she wanted someone to protect her and  to feel normal    And then there is her relationship with Lee  I thought I hated how passive it was in the film  Until they meet again I genuinely thought he was her gay bestie and the posters were misleading on purpose  But boy was that 1000 times better than what I can only describe as the Alpha Omega furry fiction gone mild that happened in the book  If it ever peeks your curiosity and you get your hands on it  the first chapters about Maren s childhood are very good  The book actually starts with one of the best quotes I ve laid my eyes on  Someday I ll wake up and find they built a maze around me and I would be relieved   but it s only downhill from there ;636
2134;2023-05-27 03:45:00;3.0;She s sniffing the corners of every guy s mouth too much   it s honestly a little sad that people who are into that stuff probably won t come across it ;1947

2136;2023-05-27 13:42:00;22.0;Eric Hill died in 2014  I haven t done an exact count  but there have been at least 30 books in the Spot series released since his death  Every single book is attributed to him    This Penguin Random House page on the series is surreal   https   www penguinrandomhouse com series DVG spot page 1   I hate that they do it this way  because Hill s Spot books are very cute  but the new ones are miserably soulless  Does this happen a lot  I know they re still churning out Curious Georges and Cat in the Hats  but they attribute those to the new author  or at least don t claim Rey Seuss wrote them  ;2155

2138;2023-05-27 13:00:00;30.0;VK Andrews has published far more books dead than she ever did while she was alive ;278

2141;2023-05-26 16:21:00;6.0;This is a rights thing  So  the people  likely his fam  who have the rights to the image and character  can create a ton of stuff   probably outlines by the artist before death  Bill Martin Jr just published a book with his longtime co writer and Bill dies ages ago  His co writer  Michael Sampson  said that they had piles of books they worked on together  He just develops them further every few years with the people who run Bill s rights  So  Depends on who owns what post mortem  I think every kids author needs to stop making a book for every little holiday  The stories are always dumb  and it may be confusing for Pout Pout fish to celebrate Easter  Or Peppa Elmo Pete the cat to celebrate literally every holiday ;2224

2152;2023-05-26 16:53:00;0.0;I think it s like  Eric Hill s Spot Series  or  Created by Eric Hill   They specifically don t say  by Eric Hill      TV is the same  If you start a TV show and work on it for season 1  not only will the entire series say  created by you  but so will the spin off which you had nothing to do with ;290
2153;2023-05-27 04:01:00;17.0;Wow  that s insane  Simon   Schuster just straight up say she alone writes her posthumous releases   I didn t realize anonymous ghost writers were employed after an author died  What a gross practice  I wish publishers had to be upfront about it ;822

2159;2023-05-26 15:25:00;3.0;We re talking about Spot here  The little yellow dog  I don t think Eric Hill could ve been arsed to write rough drafts on how Spot feels about tractors or how he ll fare at preschool   It s a simple series to get up in arms about  but the post Hill Spot is a miserable excuse for a children s book series  and it s sad that he is credited with abomination after catastrophe of saccharine  corporate  literary shmegma    You may think   Jeez bro  it s Spot   Yeah  well  go read some legit Eric Hill Spot  and then go read Spot s Hide and Seek  and if you don t throw up in your mouth a little you don t have a soul ;1998
2160;2023-05-26 16:42:00;3.0;In many of those cases  such as Tom Clancy  the cover of the book will  tell  you the actual name of the person who wrote it  IMO it s fine if the ghostwriter is anonymous  but they should always tell you they re a ghostwriter   In some cases  eg Agatha Christie  Ian Fleming  H P  Lovecraft  a modern reader would know they have died already  Still  they should say  ghostwritten  IMO ;1918

2182;2023-05-30 03:46:00;6.0;It s understandable to take time to grieve over the end of a particularly good book  but the good news is there are two sequels  Little Men  much more of a children s book  and Jo s Boys  which are both entertaining  Little Men was written to capitalize on the success of Little Women  and is focused on a narrower time period and younger set of characters than the first book  although it is still a continuation of the March family s story  Jo s Boys was written later in Louisa May Alcott s career  when she was a successful  well established writer with greater agency over her content    If you like Louisa May Alcott s writing  many fans of Little Women also particularly enjoy her books Eight Cousin and Rose in Bloom  as well as An Old Fashioned Girl  They re not March family stories  but are similar in tone and told with Alcott s intelligence and humor ;1227

2193;2023-05-26 19:09:00;8.0;Yes  and I like the way Greta Gerwig incorporated biographical details about Louisa May Alcott into the film  I thought it worked well and made an interesting point about how Alcott altered the life of Jo to diverge from her own  even though she loosely based Jo s story on her own ;1959
2194;2023-05-26 22:47:00;10.0;I ve said this before and I ll say it forever  the 2018 version is worth it for a lot of reasons  but it  actually makes Amy likable   Greta Gerwig is magic  and Florence Pugh too ;903
2195;2023-05-26 23:19:00;3.0; but it actually makes Amy likable   Well  that might be a bridge too far  Haha  But she certainly made her memorable  In this version  Amy seemed more like a serious artist  Now I want to see every movie Pugh is in ;1557
2196;2023-05-26 14:59:00;13.0;I dont know  I really think she s likeable after her character growth  Dont get me wrong  teen Amy is a pill and a toxic little brat  But she s something like  14  then  I know I d hate to have 14 year old me held against me a decade later   For adult Amy   For starters she is absolutely 100  correct about her stress being the only sister considering the reality of what marriage means for women their family s livelihood   She is under enormous  completely valid pressure  The other sisters marrying only for love would be the equivalent of a modern person choosing to not work a job and instead pursue only hobbies  Enviable  yes  Preferable  Maybe ideally  Genuinely causing a risk of a family  starving   to death  because no one is paying bills    yes     If you take that  and  realize that she is completely in love with   Lori   during the scene where she   tells him off    it paints a picture of a character who makes difficult decisions and sacrifices her own wants for the good of her family  and who has steadfast morals that aren t swayed even when faced with   lifelong infatuation    I could only hope that if I had a daughter  she d know to make sure to never let the approval of a man sway her values she holds dear  just like Amy ;1235
2197;2023-05-26 14:32:00;2.0;I agree with all you re saying here  To add  we never get to see the others at the age we see young Amy  Beth and Meg may never have been total brats  especially Beth   but Jo certainly would have had her moments  We don t see that in the book though  so Amy bears the brunt of being viewed as the childish and immature and bratty one   But what I love about Amy  and what I never quite understood from the book alone  she isn t just a snob who happens to grow into a mature adult by chance  Amy was quite literally groomed to be somebody s rich wife  to be the next Aunt March  She managed to do this  but she ALSO managed to marry for love  She refused to compromise herself or her values  and by doing so ended up with it all  Jo could have had this   Aunt March would have groomed her instead  but eventually realized Jo s stubbornness left her a lost cause  so to speak  It s Amy who turns out to be the one who can float in the world of the rich without losing herself to do it ;2252

2237;2023-05-27 01:23:00;99.0;A Hospital Visit Reveals Medieval Secrets Hidden in Books  Using CT scanning on 16th century books  researchers uncovered bits of parchment salvaged from handwritten manuscripts    Books within the portal of a CT scanner  with a person in medical garb including a blue smock  a mask and a hair covering behind a window in the background   Other methods of scanning Medieval books faced limitations so researchers decided to try CT scanning to see what fragments they concealed within their bindings Credit   Eric Ensley  By Katherine Kornei  May 23  2023  Even in medieval times  recycling was in vogue  Bits of parchment salvaged from older handwritten manuscripts were often used to reinforce other books  Using CT scanning  a team of researchers has now shown that those medieval leftovers hidden beneath some books  covers can be seen  Studying these medieval binding fragments can help reveal how  when and where early books were assembled  and there s always the tantalizing possibility of finding a previously unknown manuscript   In Europe  books were reproduced by hand up until the middle of the 15th century  Known as manuscripts   the Latin root  manu  means  hand    those written records were often works of art in their own right  with multiple colors of ink flowing across meticulously prepared sheets of calf  goat or sheep skin   However  with the printing press becoming common in Europe in the 1450s there wasn t much of a need for such manuscripts  But some book binders opted to reuse their parchment pages    They could use the older  more durable manuscript to help reinforce the structure of a new printed book   said Eric Ensley  the curator of rare books and maps at the University of Iowa   Binders would cut pieces of parchment   sometimes full pages  sometimes just thin strips   and glue them on places like a book s spine  The book would then be covered  and most of those binding fragments would be hidden from view    There s actually a whole library within a library in the form of these fragments   said Joris Dik  a materials scientist who studies binding fragments at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and was not involved in the new study   In recent decades  researchers have begun peering beneath book covers using noninvasive techniques to to find medieval binding fragments and read what s written on them  But many of those techniques have limitations  which prompted Dr  Ensley and his colleagues to try CT scanning  the same kind available in a hospital  The technique s three dimensional view solves the focus problems that plagued other methods  and a scan can be completed in seconds rather than the hours previously required   Image A three book set of a 16th century encyclopedia of animals was taken from the University of Iowa s archives and put into a CT scanner at the university s medical college  Credit   Eric Ensley  The team scanned a three book set of  Historia animalium   an encyclopedia of animals printed in the 16th century  One book would serve as a control  the researchers decided  because its cover was damaged and could be peeled back to reveal medieval binding fragments   featuring red and black ink   on the spine  The other two books were intact  However  the researchers hypothesized that their spines might also contain fragments because the books appeared to have been bound in the same workshop  said Katherine H  Tachau  a historian at the University of Iowa and a member of the research team   Under the watchful eye of Giselle Simon  the conservator at the University of Iowa Libraries  the team placed the three books on the bed of a CT scanner in the lab of Eric Hoffman at the university s Carver College of Medicine  The books fit with room to spare  and scanning all three took under a minute   With Dr  Tachau  Dr  Ensley watched the hidden text of some of the binding fragments being revealed on the scanner s screen    We both leaned in and started reading the Latin together   he said   It was a goose bumps moment    Image Many of the fragments found in the scans came from a Latin Bible that was handmade centuries before the printed books used in the experiment Credit   Eric Ensley  Many of the medieval binding fragments in the  Historia animalium  came from a Latin Bible dating to the 11th or 12th century  the team reported in April in the journal Heritage Science   When the researchers analyzed the CT scans of their control book  they found that letters written in red ink were most pronounced in the images  Darker inks  however  did not show up as clearly  The different chemicals in the inks affect how they absorb X rays  But by varying the energy of X rays emitted by a CT scanner  it might be possible to better detect black inks in future studies  Dr  Ensley and his collaborators hypothesize   The fragments the team uncovered will be ultimately digitized in Fragmentarium  an online repository of more than 4 500 medieval binding fragments  The archive is a way to disseminate the information contained in these hidden pieces of history  said William Duba  a historian at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland who coordinates Fragmentarium    The spines of books are hiding treasures   he said ;773

2269;2023-05-26 16:42:00;7.0;When I read pride and prejudice I do not imagine Elizabeth as a 6 ft hairy man ;980
2270;2023-05-26 17:41:00;4.0;I love first person it s probably my favourite way to read and write  It s more like how you describe  it s like being at a party and a self absorbed  but very entertaining  friend is telling a story about themselves  and the audience is hooked lol   I don t project myself into the narrative of a first person story when I read  I step into the shoes of the protagonist and experience their viewpoint for a while  Like literally reading their diary  so to speak  I don t pretend it s my diary   It is definitely easier to project yourself in 3rd person   especially if the protagonist is somewhat subdued  blank  or lacking in personality  like Harry Potter or the one from Twilight   and all the action is happening to them and around them and they have to react to it  or roll with it  or do something to make the story keep moving  We can pretend we re the ones it is happening to   And some people prefer projecting themselves into a story and going along for the ride  Totally valid  I enjoy it too  It is great   necessary  even   for certain kinds of story   But that s not the point of first person IMO  It s two different ways to enjoy different types of story   first person protagonists can t really be blank or lacking  because you re supposed to know their perspective  opinions  and feelings about what is going on  So projection is less possible because they won t think the same way I think  But I personally find it easier to root for the protagonist in first person   even when they make mistakes  are unreliable  and even unlikeable  Because you see into their mind  and even if you disagree with their actions  empathy comes more naturally when you ve learned their own thought processes   Of course this is all just my opinions based on what I ve read in 3rd and 1st person  and from my attempts at writing stories in those formats too ;682
2271;2023-05-26 18:29:00;5.0;So  did you read the same books as your friend and have a different reaction   You might have the same opinion of the books  but frame it differently     I like to see different perspectives through books  but I definitely disconnect when the main character does certain kinds of things that I wouldn t do  like sabotage themselves or betray a friend ;1044
2272;2023-05-26 19:51:00;6.0;For me it s less about being the person and more about needing to understand their decisions and agree with them   They have to be acting  normal   Or my version of it    The perspective only highlights the issue  First person needs to be closer to my thoughts for it to resonate  Third person has a bit more leeway because they also can give context ;1571
2273;2023-05-26 20:06:00;4.0;Sometimes I imagine narration in my own voice  sometimes the author s  sometimes a podcaster or actor who s voice I am fond of             ;913
2274;2023-05-26 21:06:00;19.0;First Person Perspective    A character is telling their own story  Ex  I dont know where I m going    Second Person Perspective   The writer addresses the reader using the pronoun  you   It forces the reader into the story  Ex  You dont know where you re going     Third Person Perspective The author is telling the story of different characters  but is not part of the action themselves   Ex  They dont know where they re going  ;1365
2275;2023-05-26 21:40:00;4.0;For me  it mostly depends on the author s writing skill    Meaning that if this is a Lucy Foley book  I m not seeing any character in her multiple first person POVs as me  because they are all blandly written and not very distinguishable from each other  the  me  when reading is outside the book calmly trying to figure out who the murderer is   Which is also fun  I m not saying she s a horribly bad writer  just that she s very much a plot writer and POV writing is not her strong suit    On the other hand  Caroline Kepnes in You can successfully make me feel like I AM Joe Goldberg  make me feel everything he feels  even though he murders innocent people and is also pretty misogynist  Because she s really good at writing characters    As for inserting  myself  into the narrative  that s not the same thing as temporarily subsuming the self into the character s POV  and I mostly don t do it  When I do  it s usually a frustrating experience  Example  here I am reading this romance novel where the whole book is clearly meant to be a self insert fantasy  and then the heroine acts in a wimpy way I would never act  immersion is broken and I throw the book across the room ;1399
2276;2023-05-26 21:55:00;3.0;I didn t know people did that  The narrator is whatever character the author is writing first person for ;175
2277;2023-05-26 18:38:00;3.0;If I m not making choices  I don t see myself as the protagonist or any other character  but I can relate to characters though   If I want to feel in charge and in a narrative  i play games;659
2278;2023-05-27 13:26:00;3.0;I might occasionally imagine myself into parts of the story if the narrator is having a good time  but I never read a first person narrator as  me  ;1114
2279;2023-05-26 23:38:00;3.0;Somewhere in between  Yes  I see myself as the main character  but not in an  I m identical to them   I believe books are written for you to be sympathetic to the main character and to try and find ways you relate to them   Many characters are underdogs and that appeals to us  because we like to think we can succeed and overcome in bad situations  We like to think we d make the hard  yet moral choice    I don t think it would be nearly as enjoyable if you were reading and the main character is a piece of crap with no redeeming qualities  Look at Joffrey from GOT  If he was an MC in a book  you wouldn t like it  It s because he s an irredeemable turd  You d have no sympathy for him because he does nothing to deserve it  You d hate he wasn t going to get smacked down for his attitude  because as the MC  he d have plot armor   So I don t see myself as the MC  but I look for things that let me relate or things that resonate with me  It s possible your friend simply meant that not enough of the character resonated with them to make it an enjoyable read ;1399
2280;2023-05-27 04:03:00;3.0;I think first person perspective books that can make YOU feel like the main character are the novels worth reading  It takes a lot of engagement and connection to make a reader to experience something imaginary  But I don t think it s necessary boring when reading a book with a main character that I cannot relate to      read more of my reviews at  readingoverreality com  https   readingoverreality com   ;1983
2281;2023-05-26 21:54:00;7.0;No it s not a fucking video game;1126
2282;2023-05-26 17:46:00;7.0;I personally do  This is my own little hypothesis  but IMO your capacity to see yourself in the character s shoes is influenced by your own self image or impressionability    Probably a bad example but when I was sort of an emo back in high school I thought Catcher in the Rye was badass  So yeah I imagined myself in Holden s shoes lmfao    It makes sense to me since you are essentially delving into the character s mindset  thought process  and also allowing yourself to experience their perception of their world  That immersion could resonate if you find aspects of yourself reflected in the character ;1373
2283;2023-05-26 14:12:00;2.0;I like when characters have traits I share  then I can see how they bump into things and if I can pick up any tricks on how live ;2146
2284;2023-05-27 00:29:00;2.0;Hm  I had to take a minute to figure out what I envision when reading first person  am I resting in the narrator s body  trying to watch the story unfold through their eyes  That definitely happens if I m  writing  narratives in my head  even if I m thinking about a character that s clearly not me   or sometimes I ll get an inkling of that feeling playing video games  But both of those examples have that key element of choice and imagination  whereas reading a book in first person the choices are made  the character s thoughts are their own  So I still picture the scenes as an outside observer   That said  I sort of get your friend s point about connecting with  relatable  narrators  A few of my favorite books written in first person have had main characters that feel familiar in some way  and those moments of  wow I ve felt this exact way and here it is in words  can be pretty special ;54
2285;2023-05-26 19:24:00;2.0;I consider it to be like hitching a ride in someone else s brain  I get to see what they see and hear what they think about it  and get an understanding of someone else s perspective from an intimate way ;2241
2286;2023-05-27 00:25:00;2.0;I am not a fan of 1st person voice  I find it distracting    First person makes it harder for me to draw on things in my experience and mind that add to the story  If I read that a character is walking down the street on a foggy night  First person often limits me to what the author says  I ve walked plenty of foggy night streets and just those three words bring to mind footsteps in the distance  or a trolly car bell ringing  the smell of the bay not too far away and the lights of the bridge shrouded in fog   My mind pulls all that in and for me that part of the fun of reading   When reading it is like I am a silent observer to everything that is going on  That may explain why I am not a fan of brutal violence or descriptive sex ;930
2287;2023-05-30 06:55:00;2.0;imagine reading A Confereacy of Dunces and imagining yourself as Ignatius;2382
2288;2023-05-26 15:00:00;2.0;Did your friend not pay attention in English class when they did the unit on point of view  First person books are the character narrating the story  second person is where the author narrates what the reader is doing or did  third person is the one we all know and love  Simple as that ;11
2289;2023-05-27 12:43:00;2.0;I ve always read first person as if someone were   telling   me the story   I may get annoyed with a character for one reason or another  but it s  usually  not because the character is doing something that I wouldn t do   I also might see myself more in a character who  isn t  telling the story  so I guess it just depends on the story and the characters for me     ;2363
2290;2023-05-28 21:17:00;2.0;Some characters are obviously meant to be generic and ambiguous enough to be  relatable  to everyone  but I don t think we re supposed to literally place ourselves in the story unless it s written that way choose your own adventure books  for example  ;1398
2291;2023-05-26 15:14:00;2.0;No I never imagine myself as the main character  I cast the first person as they are described in the book  However I always cast Stephen King as the main character in all of his stories   no matter the gender or features of his lead character he is always writing them as a version of himself ;1190
2292;2023-05-27 07:47:00;2.0;Kinda    I like reading first person and imagine what it s like to be the person telling the story  It doesn t matter if the MC is really different ;1568
2293;2023-05-26 21:56:00;2.0;It sounds like your friend is treating first person narrative like a first person video game  where you re somewhat meant to be  in the shoes  of the protagonist or player character  With books  the point isn t generally to project yourself into a character but it s a device to limit and focus your perspective as the events unfold ;1451
2294;2023-05-26 14:56:00;2.0;Is your friend big into fan fiction  There s a big genre called self insert fan fiction where you are supposed to imagine yourself as the character  Maybe they just continued that mindset for other books ;9
2295;2023-05-27 02:20:00;2.0;I personally read a book like I watch a movie   But to the people who are saying it s weird or wrong  are just judgmental and rude  People read books for many different reasons  not just the standard 1st 2nd  or 3rd  point of view  Some people read books as a way to live through something they wouldn t in real life  Some people read certain things to help them heal from some kind of trauma that have experienced  Just because you don t read books that way  does not make it wrong or creepy or that they are dumb  It s just different ;134
2296;2023-05-26 23:55:00;2.0;By design  the protagonist is supposed to resonate with normal people otherwise we wouldn t empathize with them  What the protagonist learns is what you are supposed to learn  So  by extension  the protag IS you   And yes  when I m reading a romance novel  I absolutely pretend it s me and the guy is Jensen Ackles   ;1545
2297;2023-05-29 18:16:00;3.0;No  I m enjoying someone else s art  vision  words ;2083
2298;2023-05-27 07:59:00;3.0;I think lots of people read like your friend  I know people who only read first person because they say they can t get into the story if it s 3rd person  even if they don t think the character is the reader directly  they put themselves in the events as if they were inside their brains so if it s too different it s jarring ;1233
2299;2023-05-26 22:47:00;2.0;I can t read a book without imagining myself as the main character  Third person or first person point of view  I have this joke where I claim I m similar to an actress because I have played so many roles due to how many people I ve been due to me reading a lot of books  ;1138
2300;2023-05-26 15:06:00;1.0;No     I find that weird ;1117
2301;2023-05-27 04:42:00;1.0;Yeah  Wait we aint supposed to project ourselves into characters  I was reading things the wrong way  Oof  dang ;144

2303;2023-05-27 01:26:00;1.0;i ve never thought of the narrator as myself while reading tbh  it seems her perspective is quite unique on this one lol   edit  fixed typo ;1130
2304;2023-05-27 00:11:00;0.0;No  why would I that s so weird    My favourite books are the ones where the characters are so far removed from my reality that I see a totally new experience    I am currently reading a book about a dragon going on an adventure trying to find the author of a mysterie book ;1657
2305;2023-05-26 15:12:00;-1.0;Your friend sounds somewhat unsophisticated ;112
2306;2023-05-27 08:18:00;1.0;No  Last time I did that I had my heart broken ;37
2307;2023-05-28 10:06:00;1.0;no  definitely not;2347
2308;2023-05-26 15:33:00;1.0;I write in first person  and I am telling the reader my  fictious  story  Readers who know me tell me they feel like I m talking to them  That s my intent  but that s just me   As a reader  I usually feel like the first person author is talking to me ;2232
2309;2023-05-27 08:23:00;1.0;I d say it s one step further than a friend at a party  to me it s like having a backseat inside someone s head  or reading their personal diary depending on how it s written ;269
2310;2023-05-26 22:53:00;1.0;No  I always imagine him as separate character  In FPP I get a feeling like sitting next to him and listening him spin the tale  Games are where I project myself into character ;725
2311;2023-05-27 08:28:00;1.0;I ve never imagined myself as a character in any media  at least since I wanted to be Knuckles for a hot minute in 1995  Stories are always about other people to me  and I m invisible  simply watching the events ;534
2312;2023-05-27 08:33:00;1.0;At first I thought this idea was very strange  but really it s about the   degree   of projection  Like I do try  to some extent  to perceive the basic senses of the character  to sort of mentally see through their eyes or hear through their ears  that sort of thing  just to put the world of the book together in my head  But I don t go so far as to think that I  am  them or that the actions of the character are ones that I personally would justify  it s not that kind of relationship    I mean if you are sitting down with a friend and they are telling you a story about something that happened to them  they re naturally going to do that in first person  It makes sense to try to visualize what they are talking about  and you only have their perspective to go from  But it would be strange to start thinking you are meant to  project yourself  into that story  and I don t think fiction works much differently ;281
2313;2023-05-27 11:15:00;1.0;No  I don t ;930
2314;2023-06-10 09:58:00;1.0;I don t  but I can t read a book where the main character does things that are too far removed to what I would do in that situation  So books where I think the character is really really dumb or completely irrational don t work for me  It has to be kind of extreme though ;1265
2315;2023-06-16 20:03:00;1.0;Your friend should try a choose your own adventure story;1883
2316;2023-06-16 19:11:00;1.0;No never ;651
2317;2023-06-16 16:51:00;1.0;Nope  never ;867

2320;2023-06-16 21:17:00;-1.0;No one reads the way your friend is describing  It s very strange and a little creepy  They should probably interrogate why they would read someone else using  I  and  me  as somehow referring to the reader ;478
2321;2023-06-16 16:28:00;0.0;Here s something to think about  Almost always  no matter the point of view  the protagonist s  of a novel are psychologically more similar to  you  than any other possible relationship  Think of your closest friend  Your longest term lover  Your attached at the hip sibling  You do not and cannot know their every internal thought  every action they take from point a to point b  every formative moment in their history  You cannot know this about any real person other than yourself  So  even if a character is nothing like you  you inhabit their mind more similarly to how you inhabit your own  and it s nothing like how you know even your closest people ;179
2322;2023-06-16 19:09:00;0.0;Your friend s take is truly bizarre  The only books were you  the reader  are the main character are choose your own adventures  and those are written in the second person     You try and climb the up the cliff  but the spray from the waterfall makes everything wet and slippery  You only get a few feet off of the ground before losing purchase and falling back to the surface below  Oh no  You fall directly on a large rock and roll your ankle  How will you get out of here with an injured leg      That sort of thing ;2249
2323;2023-06-16 16:27:00;3.0;Same but with The Awakening and The Bell Jar  I think I needed to put both books down  Don t believe I finished;2399
2324;2023-06-16 16:27:00;2.0;Why does this make you feel upset and uncomfortable ;408
2325;2023-06-16 16:56:00;69.0;I ll go a step further and say that his take actually detracts from the impact that reading a first person narrative can have    In my opinion  reading a story in first person is the closest thing to experiencing someone else s thoughts  When you re truly immersed  you can start to feel the way their voice is shaped  and the way that they process things  In the best cases you can carry a little of that with you into your life  Maybe it s just me  but when I m really into a book  my thoughts will start to take the same shape as the narrator s  That s an amazing experience  basically like a short cut to empathy  I feel like you miss that completely by projecting yourself onto the narrator ;465
2326;2023-06-16 20:37:00;0.0;It really depends on the author  In the Twilight series  Bella was purposely written kind of  blank  with no physical description given  so the reader could more easily self insert into the character   In the Anita Blake series  the first person POV is very obviously an avatar for the author ;2171

2329;2023-06-16 23:27:00;0.0;Just because someone doesn t read something in the exact way you would  doesn t mean they are wrong or lack reading comprehension  People read for many different reasons ;2200
2330;2023-06-16 17:12:00;3.0;I think there s a fine line between stepping into their shoes and projecting yourself as them it seems pretty similar to me and I think that s what op s friend meant  if you are stepping into their shoes and they do something terrible you would never do you won t be able to really experience the viewpoint ;2355

2333;2023-06-16 18:06:00;6.0;I don t think it s either or  I empathize extremely with the characters  I just don t literally think it s me  I love my friends  but I don t need to think the are me to empathize with them ;1637

2335;2023-06-16 16:49:00;8.0;I didn t read that book and don t feel this way  but a friend told me that they don t like to relate too much with the main character because for this relatability to happen  their unconscious  ugly  internal thoughts are now on paper as part of this character  It makes them feel called out on the things they don t like about themselves  This person also admitted to some specific self esteem issues   A different friend avoids stories that are too relatable in terms of traumatic experiences because it s retraumatizing   Not sure what the first commenter s personal experience is but I am always interested in how others experience fiction ;654
2336;2023-06-16 16:56:00;14.0;What you described is actually closer to op s friend than op  Projecting yourself onto the character or them onto you is kind of the same thing  they mesh together  Op was saying they think it s like a friend telling you a story so no meshing happens;1601
2337;2023-06-16 16:59:00;3.0;Right  and  I m assuming OP s friend actually meant stories where  you  is used   it has a sense of immediacy to it  so you have to experience things as the character does   I can sort of understand if OPs friend is actually reading character X reader fanfic or some other wish fulfilment stuff  where yes  the idea is to self insert  But in that case it doesn t exactly matter how they react to it  it s not serious ;894
2338;2023-06-16 17:28:00;1.0;A Conspiracy of Truths is written that you re listening in on a story told to someone referred to as  you   The  you  in the story is described as taking actions and making decisions  but you don t actually  see  them happening    paraphrased examples   after finishing a folktale    Anyway  I know you ve heard this story before  Don t laugh      Later  if you like  you could travel south and take the capital  It would be easy for you  I know it would      Remember when we first met  You were so surprised that I knew the welcome song   Is this not technically first person  I would figure a true second person would be something like a choose your own  or maybe some kind of horror novel where you don t control your own  actions  ;1316
2339;2023-06-16 17:54:00;1.0;The few books I ve read that use excessive use of second person tend to be extremely personal  specific works that use  you  as a means of imitating the author talking directly to a character  and it s always raw and emotional   Second person projection fiction is almost entirely a fanfic trope ;1569

2352;2023-06-16 14:23:00;3.0;Right  and romance main characters are written in a certain relatable way where it s meant to be immersive  experience what they are experiencing  But if I were reading a first person serial killer  I would want to understand the mind but not be immersed in the mind    And most people who read for example thrillers don t read romance  and vice versa    Curious to know what OP s friend favorite genres are ;1988

2360;2023-06-16 00:25:00;4.0;I wanted to like this book   No  I wanted to be blown away by Sagan   Sadly  I was far from it  It took Sagan 19 chapters of 25 to get to his point  And it was a slog the entire way  So while he raises a good point  he takes forever to make it and spent most of a book rehashing the same analogy instead of more ideas  suggestions  discussion on the main point   science is a faltering area that needs to be not only shored up  but encouraged  fostered  shared  and basically bolstered for so many reasons;1479

2378;2023-06-16 21:25:00;7.0;I start whatever I can get first at the library ;2438
2379;2023-06-16 22:45:00;2.0;I can paralyze myself by over thinking this  Fiction  Non fiction  History  Biography  Fun fiction  Literary fiction  I just read a British writer  should I read an American  Translated fiction  Aaaaaaaaaa it s too hard to decide  I ll just play on my phone   Usually I ll just grab something on a whim either from my shelves or from the library or occassionally a bookstore  Sometimes I ll have something specific that I ve heard about  but not often    The key to this process is having the ability to stop reading if your choice turns out wrong  which it sometimes does  If you re one of those people who has to finish what you start then you need more forethought ;561
2380;2023-06-16 14:27:00;2.0;Look at book shelf   Find book     Shrug    I guess this looks fine   Read until finished or bored ;2004
2381;2023-06-16 01:13:00;2.0;I have probably 100 books at home I haven t read yet  Deciding what to read basically consists of skimming my shelf and landing on what  feels right  in the moment ;2218
2382;2023-06-16 17:57:00;1.0;I contrast  unless I m in a mood for something in particular  So after The Trial I d probably pick up The Unconsoled then Middlemarch then The Goldfinch ;487
2383;2023-06-15 23:24:00;1.0;Normally logistics are the deciding factor   library due dates  new releases by authors I like  or the form of the book what I m doing  I don t like bringing physical books outside of home  for example  so a bus book needs to be digital   Otherwise it s based on mood mostly ;1740
2384;2023-06-16 01:18:00;1.0;I just read whatever comes up from my list of Holds on the Libby app usually  Sometimes I scan through and add interesting books to my Hold list   If I get a recommendation I usually search for it and put on Hold if its available  If not I keep an eye out in stores or online  One time visited a local author in local book store and bought his book  If I m in dire need I ll pick a random author from one of the 5 Libraries on Libby that I have ;578
2385;2023-06-16 01:14:00;1.0;i will read a character then google  like that character ;1772
2386;2023-06-16 18:07:00;1.0;Each year I set goals and join or create reading challenges  I read a lot and trying to figure out what to read next is my biggest challenge  I primarily use the library  so at least once a month  I go through my goals and challenges and load my library queue  then I just read the books as they become available  I do try to mix up the length and genres so I don t get stuck with too much of the same thing at any one time ;365
2387;2023-06-16 08:05:00;1.0;After hearing a lot about a book from others i write them in my list and accordingly read them one by one;1589

2389;2023-06-15 23:51:00;1.0;I try to choose before I finish my current read  I ve got hundreds of unread books on my shelf and I get overwhelmed picking when I m between books so I only finish one if I have the next lined up  Less pressure to choose what s right for my mood and more motivation to finish whatever I m currently reading ;1065
2390;2023-06-16 01:32:00;1.0;Yeah but assume I already own them   I unfortunately buy a lot of my books because my library system is in the midst of  banning  everything ;1457
2391;2023-06-16 14:53:00;1.0;I usually pick a book that s very different from the one I just finished  So I d probably go for  The Goldfinch   I d think that  Never Let Me Go  or  The Haunting of Hill House  would be too dark to read on the heels of  The Trial    My husband loves horror and says  The Haunting of Hill House  is the most creepy and frightening book he s ever read    Or maybe choose a different  light read next ;1052
2392;2023-06-16 05:44:00;2.0;Man   that one single line flipped the entire story  I did believe alicia s and theo s story colliding at some point of time but didnt think it would be this way  It was that one single line that changed the whole plot and make my mind blow  PS   I am quite happy to be out of my slump now and finishing a book in less than a week;510
2393;2023-06-16 00:37:00;1.0;Surprisingly I guessed how the table would turn  In the end  I was pretty happy reading the way I guess from 1 3rd of the book ;2120

2396;2023-06-16 03:04:00;1.0;I know right  Totally didn t see that coming tbh  I ve been trying to bring my reading habit and The Silent Patient was the first book in ages I finished damn quick ;568
2397;2023-06-16 07:46:00;1.0;Oh damn   my small brain wasnt able to comprehend it soon enough but an amazing read indeed;1770
2398;2023-06-15 20:14:00;1.0;Thanx a lot   ig maybe i ended up enjoying the book more since i was finally getting out of my slump;920

2400;2023-06-15 22:14:00;1.0;Have you read the rest of the Southern Reach trilogy  Book 2 is partly a slog  partly fantastic  and book 3 is just terrific since it goes further into the strangeness of Area X with all the twisted things that the author dreamed up ;1687

2404;2023-06-15 21:35:00;3.0;100  agree  i thought the book was fantastic but that felt so wrong and out of character;1937
2405;2023-06-16 02:59:00;-1.0;I found the  you can read 28 books   on the subject kinda funny  Especially since it was targeted at people who may not know about the topic    I suspect if it were a topic not fraught with controversy  it d seem humorous to more people   Oh well  down the karma hole I go ;1169
2406;2023-06-16 07:50:00;1.0;TIL that I apparently have a fair few more books than some other people on this sub do  One of the two reasons I joined LibraryThing was to put tags on book titles  I was wasting a terrific lot of time searching for books before I did   Is this one with anthropology or religion or folktales  is that one with east Asian or French fiction  In reply to another post  it s certainly not only people in academia who have this problem   Having said that if I d not many books I d definitely shelve them for aesthetic appeal taking into consideration colour  size  appearance of spine  possibly piling some of them on top of others where that looked appealing ;806
2407;2023-06-16 08:46:00;75.0;I am reading Lovecraft s  Call of Cthulhu   Other Weird Stories  and when I try to imagine things as described such as the underwater cities of Y ha nthlei and R lyeh  the grotesquely crablike interstellar beings known as the Mi go or whatever richly detailed city  landscape or entity Lovecraft might be talking about my powers of imagination frequently fail me and pale in comparison to what I see artists  interpret by painting or drawing    Like some of the scenes they create are so brooding and atmospheric and haunting and fascinating where I m just thinking  very old bricks  very old bricks  very old bricks   I ve only started recently to pick up reading properly where previously I used to only read in school because I had too  Now I ve found that I really enjoy doing it and am trying to develop a habit  maybe symptom of growing older   but I wish I could rely less on the experience of others and trust my own mind more ;1240
2408;2023-06-16 12:15:00;58.0;hey man first things first  dont kick yourself over it  theyre just stories meant to be enjoyed reading is a private pleasure and all that matters whether you are getting something out of it  Likewise  there will always be books you like that others dont and vice versa so dont worry about the experience of others   being a little more specific to lovecraft personally hes a favourite of mine but hes definitely not eveyones cup of tea  I might go as far as to say hes a marmite author  often the very things that put people off him are the very things that others like about him so dont worry if arent enjoying his style  at least you gave him a go   now if you do decide to keep reading heres a couple of things to bear in mind about his style  you almost sound as though you feel guilty about your imagination failing you but in a sense this is exactly what lovecraft intends  not only are descriptions kept purposely vague but his stories are written from the perspective of a character trying to put into words something that they themselves cannot comprehend never mind describe accurately  Often the protagonist is driven mad with terror at what he sees  Many others feel shame at the idea of telling others about something so unbelievable perhaps only admitting to it in memoirs after their death  Most are worldly and learned men and still their powers of description fail them  so otherworldly are things they see or hear   What im trying to get at is that  for me at least  the fun of lovecraft is precisely that you are along for the ride with a rational and serious gentleman who does not want to accept the world shattering and indescribable things he is experiencing but is forced to confront or accept them while words fail them  so basically  if you cant precisely picture what the character is seeing thats because the character doesnt really know what he was seeing and is simply doing his best to put into everyday words something quite beyond ordinary experience   the other really fun part of lovecraft is that  though most stories or mini series are totally standalone  there is a larger mythos that you gradually piece together from each seemingly unrelated story which can make re reading very rewarding   just had a look at the list of stories in the particular book youre reading and ive got to say its an oddly ordered muddle of his stories  id recommend leaving anything randall carter or dream cycle till later  nyarlathotep and celephais are particularly out there and are quite literally meant to be dreamscapes so dont worry that you cant picture them  youre not really supposed to   anyway I hope you give him another chance  he holds a special place in my heart and on my bookshelf   ;1078
2409;2023-06-16 12:41:00;13.0;Lovecraft writing is weird in that he is trying to describe the indescribable  I think that the sort of point   R lyeh for example  is described as being non Euclidean  So R lyeh would have weird geometry like this  https   qph cf2 quoracdn net main qimg 53cf0a15a5eec337ed2d5a866109e355  https   qph cf2 quoracdn net main qimg 53cf0a15a5eec337ed2d5a866109e355   For example  in the colour out of space we don t even know what the colour is supposed to look like    https   lovecraftianscience wordpress com   https   lovecraftianscience wordpress com    There is a nice blog on Lovecraft and science ;1697
2410;2023-06-15 19:57:00;13.0;My favorite Lovecraft descriptions are when he describes things as  too horrible to describe  or  beyond human understanding  and then he gives long detailed descriptions ;150
2411;2023-06-15 23:19:00;20.0;You may have a degree of aphantasia  I can easily picture things in my mind if I have experienced them before  It s less easy  but I can still do it if it s something that is close to something I ve experienced before  But if it s something where I ve never seen anything like it  I can t picture it  The best thing that I can tell you is to look at what artists create  It will help  And if you can see it in movies or TV or youtube where it s moving  that s even better ;2431
2412;2023-06-15 20:33:00;8.0;I m not a fan of Lovecraft s writing  and haven t read much of it  so this is obviously biased  I don t think he does a great job of describing the spooky environments  and I also find it hard to imagine them   I think he is too fond of obscure words like  gibbous  to describe a scene  and over uses them without regard for whether they actually describe a scene in more detail or make it more interesting   I m able to imagine scenes from other scifi and fantasy authors just fine ;553
2413;2023-06-16 05:53:00;2.0;Don t leap to diss on yourself  There are plenty of people who float through culture  undiagnosed  with subtle neurological traits that affect how they absorb stimuli    An extreme example would be color blindedness  but there are many other low level conditions too  Some individuals can t perceive certain odors  or they can t describe scents in words    Visualization from symbols imagery is another big area where individual capacities can differ widely  but we all just gloss over it in the interests of  going along  and because that s the flow of life these days   After all  if it never causes any functional hazard  your folks and your teachers  never would guess that they need to have you taken to a neuro to get it looked at ;1477
2414;2023-06-15 20:39:00;2.0;Aaw  your imagination doesn t suck  And it s okay if you can t  see things  as described  I was thinking  maybe if you want to exercise your imagination muscle  you could look at pictures online of fan renditions of the monsters  Or on midjourney and blender  I love reading a book and imagining what I see and then  because I want to feel connected to the consciousness of the fanbase  I google and see what others have visualized  It s so much fun  I just finished rereading Discworld so I have been all over pinterest and other platforms just looking at fan art and I find myself going     hhmm  my version of Rincewind is taller  or  Yep   that s deginitely Mort     If you are one of those tech savvy people  you could use the prompts in the book and churn out a visual and then you have your own little photoalbum for your own imagination  A little boost   r midjourney and r blender   ;1607

2416;2023-06-15 21:56:00;2.0;I ll be honest  Lovecraft isn t all that great imo  so it might not just be your imagination ;2363

2418;2023-06-16 03:33:00;1.0;Hmmm have a go with  A Man Called Ove    Maybe it s the dense description which is too much    Some books are just harder  I say this having quit on book 5 of Wheel of Time    I got back into reading with Robin Hobbs   quickly finding out that it was a pretty long process with tens of thousands of pages across the series  and a few huge shifts in perspective   broadly chopped up into trilogies   Fortunately it was okay  with few  dry  spots which I just got through by finding the audiobook and listening whilst  reading the book on the TV using foliate  https   i imgur com 4B23X9Q png    However  by far the EASIEST and in many ways the best read of the last two years was the story of Ove   You have to be careful with recommendations   I recently picked up Narnia books to read with my son and  quite frankly  I m shocked at just how bad it is TBH  Way outdated attitudes   my son  who s 11 now  devoured The Hobbit but couldn t get more than 2 paragraphs into Narnia  I just gave up and deleted it at that point    Now he s reading  Troofriend  https   i imgur com 4B23X9Q png  and jumps up when I tell him to take a 40 minute break from his game to read   ;1140
2419;2023-06-16 05:59:00;1.0;Honestly  I have to google things to get an idea how things might look even a little bit  I have a hard time seeing scenes in my head or how people look  I think there s a word for it  but idk  It is more common than you think tbh ;2309
2420;2023-06-15 22:04:00;1.0;As you get back into reading again  your mind will re sharpen and the images and surroundings along with the atmosphere the author wants to convey to you will start to take more form in your mind s eye  You could also try audio books if you find that the reading aspect actually distracts from being able to imagine ;851
2421;2023-06-15 22:18:00;1.0;Same here  but I am trying to cope by training my imagination via Image Streaming  It helps  but when I stop training my lazy brain returns to using same known characters from TV shows nad games  I think it has to do with Asperger s somehow  Like I am sometimes completely unable to create my own image  it s always a vague recombination of something I ve seen before ;2310
2422;2023-06-15 21:31:00;1.0;I also find it hard to imagine them;2420
2423;2023-06-15 20:43:00;1.0;I don t force myself to imagine the landscape down to the last details  I read the text once or twice  trying to imagine whats being described  Mostly I get it on the second try;1765
2424;2023-06-15 22:02:00;1.0;if you have to ask this question  then I am sorry to tell you that there is likely a problem ;112
2425;2023-06-15 22:45:00;1.0;The point of Lovecraft is that these places are meant to be somewhat incomprehensible  if you could imagine them easily  it wouldn t quite be Lovecraftian ;367
2426;2023-06-15 21:25:00;1.0;Someone else mentioned aphantasia  but I think what is also missing from most comments is the creative process for making images  The illustrators are likely reading and re reading those passages related to drawing the creatures and using a lot of artistic license in drawing them  The illustrating process for a lot of artists includes making multiple  tens to hundreds  of thumbnail sketches and then taking one or more and making more detailed sketches before deciding on one or two to make into a more finished illustration      x200B   You are focusing on reading and enjoying  the illustrators are doing work  Don t get hung up on that part  The are trying to create something that is interesting to people and will make the illustration as  cool  as they can  especially for fantasy  You might have some degree of aphantasia  you might not at all  I have no ability to imagine anything  but can still illustrate pretty well  Their process is focused on the outcome  rather than reading for pleasure  I enjoy reading even without being able to imagine anything regardless of the level of detail  Just enjoy  and try not to worry about that  Also  I would think that some of the point of the illustrations is to help provide an image for you to use in your imagination while reading ;386
2427;2023-06-16 08:15:00;1.0;Everyone processes information differently  cares about different details  I don t try to picture in exhaustive detail  but let my brain latch onto a few details   Stephen King wrote about it all as imperfect telepathy    authors and readers have a meeting of the minds  but we ll never see exactly what the author envisioned  Just enjoy the connection  Well  Lovecraft was trash  but still   You re doing fine ;1089
2428;2023-06-15 22:20:00;1.0;I wouldn t discount the power of your imagination in other senses than the specific type of visual one you describe  I m not a visual artists for example  and although I cannot often picture details in a specific character or landscape  I know I can conjure up the atmosphere in a scene and that also takes imagination  So your imagination might be more perceptive towards different elements than the ones you mention  I d say keep flowing and see where your mind brings you  Maybe some time is indeed needed for your imagination to adjust to the writing style and make some magic with it   ;103
2429;2023-06-15 20:49:00;0.0;Think of books like movies  When you get home  do you want to watch Casablanca with Humphrey Bogart  or something contemporary and fun  Grab something that s sold in airport bookstores   I ve been reading the Deathlands series  It s not highbrow literature  but I enjoy it  Like fun adventure crime books  I like Carl Hiassen  Lovecraft is not exactly easy to digest ;2267

2432;2023-06-16 08:16:00;15.0;This is probably the correct answer   I have aphantasia   I don t enjoy when books have long visual descriptions because it doesn t really do anything for me   I m pretty sure this wasn t always the case and I remember as a kid I could  see  in my imagination  I used to get pictures of skeletons that I couldn t block out and they used to terrify me   I sometimes wonder if my brain has removed that ability to protect me from the terror ;1859

2435;2023-06-16 12:47:00;1.0;Yeah  this  An illustrator doesn t just read the book and then draw what s in their head  They read the book  re read it  pull some descriptions to focus on  come up with associations  use those to look for visual references that they can use to generate ideas  so for example in this case they might look for extinct crustaceans  or alien like sea creatures   and  then  draw a few ideas to expand upon  There is a whole body of research that goes into illustrating an image  It doesn t just pop into their head as they read ;528
2436;2023-06-16 10:13:00;3.0;No  but I just imagined a human sized crab  Then I googled and found amazing stuff like this    https   en wikipedia org wiki Mi Go  media File Migo jpg  https   en wikipedia org wiki Mi Go  media File Migo jpg ;1602

2438;2023-06-15 23:37:00;10.0;Yeah  I still enjoy long descriptions but books are definitely a very different experience for me with no sight  It s odd aphantasia doesn t get talked about more  such a huge difference between humans and almost nobody seems to know about it;257

2444;2023-06-15 05:31:00;0.0;Met this sentiment two times now  At first I thought the person was nuts  but after a very smart friend mentioned the same idea  I started to wonder    Background  A couple of years ago  there s been a huge wave of censorship of childrens  books in my country  Germany   Per se  the change included the removal of both  nowadays  racist terms  as well as some  too old  words per se  The change was bemourned as  nuts  back then  both because it completely removed the words   under the carpet  style   but also because many books were changed without the author s agreement  Instead going to the copyright holders  families   with the actual author in question being mostly dead   Now  I ve never felt myself a radical with the topic of censorship  I found it dumb and backwards  Also a little cowardice  as my country  if you experienced it   has a  culture  of not actually tackling deep rooted issues  but instead panicking at the sight of symptoms  and trying to just erase   la it whack a mole style  And often because it was just so dumb   a perfect example of my countries incompetence  in that department  not per se   I liked to bring it up here and there  Gaining mostly agreement   at least until recent years   The first one who mentioned the idea was a colleague  We both work in a literature department so the topic came up  In contrast to me  she didn t seem to understand what my issue was  Not just that  She was actually in  favour  of it  Mostly saying that that way  we could not only  keep  the original stories  but also allow children to read them on their own  without them taking in any  unfavorable content   Going so far as to quote our countries reason for censorship towards Nazis   It s not that we want to censor stuff  We re just taking a stand on what s okay or not   Now  back then I didn t take her serious  Mostly because  when I tried to explain my arguments  she just sighed and rolled her eyes at me  and in the end insisted that it doesn t matter  because we ll never have an actual  bad  future like war or a new dictatorship in the future  because  we learned    A few days ago  the topic reappeared again  This time  I was talking with a good and fellow book lover of mine  Now  in contrast  my friend was luckily less   dumb as shit   naive than my colleague  In her words  she theoretically agreed with me  However  her fear was similar  It is a fact that the censored words nowadays are not accepted anymore  Even worse  They are not just old fashioned  but actually harmful to vulnerable groups  In the same way  while revised editions with remarks   disclaiming prefaces might be technically the honorable   responsible way   they still potentially teach kids bad words  Even worse  Parents might simply not buy them anymore  leaving less and less to be printed  So biting the bullet of small censorship might actually help to keep the rest of the stories alive     x200B   Now I m at a point to not know what to think  Again  for disclaimer  I m not some kind of racist boomer  I m  not  insisting the content to not be bad  Nah  Many of the words used might have not meant to be per se  hateful   but are still signs of the systematic racism and lack of exposure of the people back then  Nor am I some kind of sadist  who tries to make little kids cry  Plus  the supply   demand argument makes sense   However  on the flip side  I feel very stubborn about my principles  A story does not just tell about its content  but also about the time  thoughts and people it was written in  To censor them is to censor history  And tbf  I feel this might even prove an optimistic opportunity  Children need to learn about the harshness of life  Books are a very good and safe space to approach these topics  Especially with social media and kids having phones at 6yo  it s a matter of time until a little black kid has to learn what the N word means  Especially since many of these words are still seen as  neutral  words by older generations and are  sadly  still regularly used by many  these stories could give a better  introduction  to reality      At least  better than growing up with consistent happy stories  and then being confused why people hate them for seemingly no reason  That s how I learned it      And in general  Isn t this a dangerous route  I don t want to sound  like those people   but can we now censor any book for the same reason  Just rewriting them  While the author can t even fight explain themselves  And always being able to hold people at gunpoint the same way   Sorry  I m going down a bit of a rabbit hole  What s your opinion ;2089
2445;2023-06-16 16:03:00;3.0;I think modernizing language and diluting themes of the books are different   Here s an example  from the US  if a children s book had a questionable word or phrase   Let s say screeched like an indian   as a way to describe something then it would be better to modernize the language  Change the simile     But   Let s say that we are reading 1984 or Huckfinn or Of mice and Men   And they remove phrases or words and replace them with one s that do not match the tone or themes of the book   Then it becomes a bad thing because you are changing the authors intent ;1792
2446;2023-06-16 03:27:00;5.0;You re supposed to talk to your kids about hard things  I disagree with censoring  It changes the messaging of what the author was attempting to say  in the book  Huckleberry Finn comes to mind over on my side of the pond  Since we have had such horrendous issues with race in the US  I believe it does a disservice to black people to censor the words in the book because it is how they were spoken to and talked about  It s like erasing their history  and I think it s important to explain to children what was said  why it was said  who said it  how wrong it is  and why we don t say those things and treat people like that anymore  If they can t read it and think about it then how can you have the discussion about it  It s like when the US desegregated schools and many white people moved their children to religious schools where they were taught that the Civil War was about  states rights  and not explained that the rights the states wanted to keep was to OWN PEOPLE  It was completely glossed over  they were purposely miseducated  and it shows in our society now with the older generations being such absolute bigots  racists  and misogynists ;2417
2447;2023-06-16 02:49:00;4.0;Censorship sucks ass and censors should gtfo  It is a universal principle regardless of the political believes or motivations ;2308
2448;2023-06-14 18:18:00;13.0;I m from Germany as well  so I know what cases you are talking about  Here s my two  three  cents    1  This isn t classic state run censorship  There is no law forbidding the printing of the original versions  no one is going to be persecuted because of this  the old versions are still able to be sold  Freedom of speech is still upheld  These are private companies  deciding   with the blessing of the author s estate   to alter and modernize these texts  That is very  very important  People like to make comparisons to the Nazis or the US  but it is not a comparable situation         2  There are different ways to go about modernizing these texts  I haven t actually read any of the new versions  so I don t know if there is an explanation on the front few pages  I remember reading repritings of some old comics as a child   think Tintin and Umpah Pah   and they frequently used to do this  explaining what they changed and why  what they didn t change even though it is problematic  why  and that they wanted to get to a balance where it still has the spirit of the original art without being horribly racist  As a white German  this was one of the first instances of media discussing racism and trying to find a way to handle it that I encountered  It was an explanation that didn t try to patronize me  I do not remember what the comic was actually about  but I remember this explanation very clearly   it had a positive impact on me and my media literacy        3  Your point about there still being racist people is  I think  dogshit  The world is bad  we still have to try and make it better  Throwaway racist stuff in a book will not have a positive impact on children belonging to the affected minority  Pippi Langstrumpf is not the right medium to prepare them for the cruel world  it is meant to be a fun adventure book  and I believe that that is the story that it should be able to tell to every kid  regardless of that kid s background or skin colour ;1124
2449;2023-06-15 02:09:00;7.0;I m not sure  Children need to learn about the harshness of life  is really the argument you re intending to make  It implies there is an inevitably to  harshness   to racism   and to then refer to the use of the N word  suggests that this means racism including one of  the  most offensive slurs  Perhaps a German word you were thinking of is less harsh  I live in the UK and would very much hope that only a tiny minority of far right extremists would ever use this word  and would expect many to hesitate even over reading it aloud in contexts where the use was to highlight racism   And this response is an example of progress  of racism not just being inevitable  in itself    I d also absolutely assure you that even by the time I was a disabled teen when we read Of Mice and Men at school  the kind of approach to disability we got in it  and earlier in To Kill a Mockingbird  was the exact opposite of helpful   and these were books that were supposed to be helpful  not ones just happening to contain random ableism and racism  how is reading slurs meant to help anyone  Children who can read independently may well be reading by themselves  these books aren t always going to come with a comforting explanation and a hug from a supportive parental figure   nor would that just take away all the hurt and tendency to internalise the book s message of hate   They re also books that are read for literary and historical value   not books that are just meant to entertain children  What I d have wanted was something up to date  The experience of being personally bullied doesn t help to explain why people hate you for seemingly no reason  let alone reading ableist abuse  Realising people hate you for existing as a disabled person  as a disabled woman  isn t something you ever just get immunised to  like it s an outdated theory about drinking small quantities of poison  Reading novels and disability theory by actual disabled chronically ill  etc  people  that helps   Treating prejudice as unacceptable  not as though it s inevitable  also places the onus back on prejudiced people not to be prejudiced  rather than victims to  toughen up  ;1730
2450;2023-06-15 04:00:00;5.0;In my opinion  on this  we need to be very specific about what kind of alterations to books we are talking about  These are CHILDREN S books  so it s essential not to conflate that with any kind of book banning  changes  censorship  or alterations of adult works  It s two different issues   That said  I m 100  in favour of altering children s books to make them acceptable to a modern audience  as long as a small disclaimer is included to say that alterations were made from the original text  There are two groups of people who benefit from this   children whose parents don t screen their reading  who may uncritically absorb language and perspectives that are completely unacceptable to use nowadays  and children whose parents DO screen their reading  who will probably be prevented from accessing those stories at all  In both cases  children get access to more stories in non harmful forms  and when they re old enough to read critically  the original version is still there if they re interested  No one loses anything but children gain something with altered versions of CHILDREN s books ;1905

2452;2023-06-15 12:32:00;3.0;It s not just about teaching children certain words or not  I used to think the texts shouldn t be edited  too  I used to think that parents should just explain why we don t use those words anymore  but I was wrong  Worse  I was racist for thinking that way  because I had forgotten something  or rather someone  very important   During the debate  a TV channel asked people what they thought about the editing of those children s classics  On of the statements came from a black German woman  a mother of several children   She said she was reading to her children every night  and she wanted to read them some classic children s books  but she just couldn t do that  because there were such hurtful slurs in them   That means  we have three options   1 We can leave the texts in print as they are  but exclude or otherwise hurt some young readers   2 We can stop printing new copies of the old stories and just focus on modern books  let the classics that have entertained so many generations be forgotten   3 We can replace the hurtful slurs  so every child can still enjoy these books   Personally  I think  3 doesn t sound that bad anymore  if it means that we re not excluding any children from the full enjoyment of the old stories  What difference does it make for the context of those old adventure stories  if we replace the hurtful slurs with harmless modern expressions  As long at it doesn t mean that we remove entire chapters  or change the entire content of the story  what harm does it really do  It s not censoring stories  it s updating tiny fragments  If it were non fiction  you d want it to be up to date   And finally  if those authors were alive today  do you really think they d still use the same words  I don t ;1089
2453;2023-06-11 08:07:00;1.0; A story does not just tell about its content  but also about the time  thoughts and people it was written in  To censor them is to censor history  And tbf  I feel this might even prove an optimistic opportunity  Children need to learn about the harshness of life  Books are a very good and safe space to approach these topics   This is exactly on point and you got the right idea  Censorship is virtually always well intentioned and virtually always extremely bad  If children are deemed too young to tackle a particular story  then it should be covered a bit later when they mature  But classic stories should not be gutted and bastardized just because some monocle dropping snowflakes demand that    Especially with social media and kids having phones at 6yo  it s a matter of time until a little black kid has to learn what the N word means   Black kids learn the N word from their own community before they are able to speak ;1453
2454;2023-06-11 21:50:00;-3.0;As historical books  leave them alone    As current books in print  they should be modern and not promote things currently considered hateful   These are two different things and you re conflating them ;1746

2456;2023-06-09 04:31:00;1.0;I m sure you can find at least a dozen different Romeo   Juliet translations in your bookstores  I m sure at least one uses modern slang and freshly created words where appropriate instead of the archaic ones to make the reading experience more similar to what it was when the play came out   and I m sure you can find at least one that s almost unreadably archaic  both made specific decisions to convey meaning  Do you think of that as necessary evil or censorship   Now the children s books  I don t know what kind of person values having less editions   more slurs   unenjoyable experiences for children over archaic to modern translations  but    I don t want to be friends with them   If the original text was not archived and available  sure  that d be an issue  Amazon rewriting the books you have already purchased is an issue  Lack of funding for archiving libraries is an issue  But modernized editions of children s books and archaic texts  That s not a bigger issue than having translations in general   Edit  Publishers editing the text without permission  which they might have in the initial contract  is also an issue  but an issue courts should handle  and it s a whole separate problem;652
2457;2023-06-07 23:57:00;1.0;there is nothing quite so frightening as a well articulated defense of literary censorship ;1422
2458;2023-06-07 17:49:00;1.0;To me it depends on what the book is itself  Is the word genuinely adding any sort of context to the story or teaching anything  Would the revision fit for the setting period  Would it being replaced genuinely matter for the rest of the story at all in portrayal       x200B    because we ll never have an actual  bad  future like war or a new dictatorship in the future  because  we learned    This bit to me    This is a crock of shit    That mindset is precisely why it repeats   Disregarding that  understanding these words and those periods of time is important  It gives us an insight into how people think  spoke  etc  back then   It helps to explain the progress the has been made overtime since  Its important to not just distance from that history because when you distance from it you are making it something that isn t relatable  When I say relatable I mean    Understanding that people have the capability to be that way  including the average person   That s my perspective anyways  I feel that distancing and not actually understanding leads to not actually looking out for extremism and fixing it   With that being said  honestly I think that extreme approach was necessary in the past  That s my take anyways   But damn     we learned  lol    Folly of man ;2037
2459;2023-06-06 17:54:00;1.0;Literature does not need a political cleansing  The arguments by some for censorship are terrible  If a book isn t fit to be read   stop reading it   Let it die  Don t change it for modern sensibilities   Why mislead and lie about what an author wrote  At least put a notice clearly in the book that it has been sanitised ;752
2460;2023-06-06 20:36:00;-2.0;I find it strange how Germany really are bringing in the dark future for publications  You don t talk about shit  you just carpet rug everything   It s almost like the church being anti science  no one could have differing opinion   Back to your point  it is bullshit that they are retroactive removing or changing stories   If we can t appreciate the artwork because someone gets sad because of a word  where does the creative community stand;265
2461;2023-06-05 15:24:00;5.0; This isn t classic state run censorship  I guess I ve been a bit misleading there  Yes  this is mostly up to publishers  We do not have an actual  censorship law     The idea was mostly surrounding the supply   demand idea  If no one  is forced  to buy the original text anymore   og text with remarks   then history would be partially sanitized  as the true nature of our past slowly falls out of cultural consciousness  Like  we already have people who try to slowly brush off WW2 as   a bird s shit on German history   you probably know which scandal I mean  and have to aggressively remind people of how actually horrifying it was  When people forget  they repeat   But on the flip side  if we force people to just buy the og texts   the stories would slowly get lost  as many would not bother to deal with such complicated content   But yeah  Going so far as to say  Is this Nazi Germany  is too far      explaining what they changed and why  what they didn t change even though it is problematic  why  and that they wanted to get to a balance where it still has the spirit of the original art without being horribly racist   This is one method I m okay with  I just don t like the idea of people changing it without any hint it was changed  To say  Previously  this said X  or  This was a racist term  doesn t hide it  I luckily had an adult explain stuff to me  but I also remember at around 13yo  picking up a book that had the original terms  but explained in footnotes why X is derogatory etc     The world is bad  we still have to try and make it better    Yes  but while we try and make it better  we can t forget that the world is still bad   Throwaway stuff like e g  Pippi Langstrumpf or Jim Knopf should not just be slapped into kids faces  It should be remarked  and explained at least  It should not be simply hidden  like a Puritan mother  thinking teaching her kids sex exists will make them instant pregnant   The stories are in itself wonderful  True  That s why we have the entire debate  if they sucked  we wouldn t get so worked up   However  we also can t just let our emotions or good intentions get the better of us  The way to hell is paved with them  as we know  And sadly our country does this shit regularly ;175
2462;2023-06-04 13:04:00;5.0;All great points  The one in particular I was going to comment on was people conflating  censorship  with  editing    I know it s a fine line  and difficult to distinguish  but a publisher changing a book because they feel it will sell better isn t the same as  as you mentioned  some type of government censorship  I see the same arguments here in the US  and the same  usually intentionally misleading  conflation of the two   And I liked that you touched on this happening many time in the last century  while the authors are alive in some cases  and it s usually blown out of proportion for the sake of promoting hate more so than it is protecting the sacredness of the original work ;1952

2464;2023-06-01 17:11:00;-9.0;You make all solid points but this is very similar to critical race theory in the states imo    Why are we shoving down kids throats that the world is racist when we should just be showing them that  yes racism exists but this is how you should live and love to accept all races  By not going into all the horror stories of how horrible your ancestors were  why not just teach them positive things like how to love and accept eachother for who we are   Now for people ready to say  because we don t want to censor history  we want the truth to be TOLD  So you re telling me I need to show children videos of how the holocaust walked kids younger than them into gas chambers and then bulldozed them into pits  Because that s essentially what you re saying we should have our kids read and see  NOOOOO   That to me is just self hating bs from people who don t love themselves   teach kids love and respect  I m not saying sensor them from the cruel world  I m saying teach them the positive things they can do to make the world a better place  rather than putting it into every child s head that humans are awful and shouldn t exist  because that s essentially what critical race theory teaches ;477
2465;2023-05-29 02:47:00;3.0; Perhaps a German word you were thinking of is less harsh   Yepp  It s a bit complicated to explain  since I don t want to say the word per se  The term also starts with N and in itself just means  black   from the latin word  In earlier times  it was used the same way as  black person   which is why the entire debate exists still  and why some older folk insist it s still a day to day word   In general  my idea wasn t just a  slap  Here you go  approach  I meant it more like an active teaching device  Idk  the same way you receive maybe a copy of Hitler s  Mein Kampf  in class to show how propaganda speech looks like  But of course  method is important  This is also kinda rabbit hole in itself  Sometimes remarks don t cut it  But technically it s the parent s job  But not everyone has parents  around   So do you remove the work overall  Do you take another approach  Etc   I grew up autistic  so I kinda understand your point though  Personally  I mostly had a grievance of being shown an  idealistic world  too much  Till this day  I kinda cling to Fillmore  the ending of the Ed  Edd  n Eddy film   Helga on the couch  and  Boxing Daria  for this  You kinda need a balance most of the time  Not just show abuse  but also explain it  However  sometimes  the depiction itself helps too  Seeing someone who was not from a good background  who got abused   it made me feel seen  And though I would not read them again  many works depicting autistic characters  were good lessons to show me how NTs see people like me per se  Except that I can close a book  compared to just closing a social connection  most of the time   Sure  you never will be fully immune to the pain  But you do become desensitized or at least used to it a little  You re more alert  and get a bit better at managing things ;103

2467;2023-05-29 07:53:00;2.0; I think where your argument breaks down the easiest is that you want the derogatory words left in to teach about the reality of bigotry  but the text being edited isn t included to teach  rather to normalize  True that is often a common concern  To be exact  Many argue that even with explanations  the context might still be very normalizing   In general  I totally agree with you  When I said  it s a good teaching method   I didn t mean just slapping a book in their face and be like  Bamm   Reality     but exactly the way books like  Mein Kampf  might be handled  Interpretations are one thing and totally fine  Issue was that often you can find copies that pretend to be the original  giving no signs of  we changed stuff   In reality  there should be both  Edited versions  but also the original stories  These original stories can hence not only be entertaining  but also be used as a teaching device  Kinda like how fairy tales are watered down today too  but can also be used as original moral tales  e g  Red riding hood getting eaten   REALLY don t fucking go with strangers  ;958

2472;2023-05-29 05:15:00;3.0; That to me is just self hating bs from people who don t love themselves  Thanks for the insult  Always great to hear from a stranger    But to remain serious  You ironically spark up a good point   Personally  I think my view comes from the way I grew up  I come from a very rocky and violent environment  not only including household  but just   period  Due to this  I gravitated very early towards TV and books  which  of course didn t represent anything of my world  Instead showing mostly an  ideal  world  with a happy family  and stereotypical problems  And while those stories were wonderful escape fantasies  they often were very   confusing  Why do other children hate me for no reason  when on TV they make friends easily  Why does my Mommy hit me  when the Mommy on TV is always very nice  Etc   Now  I know that my background ain t typical  And it s not in my intention to just act edgy  or emo or  ugh   tough love  style  Instead  I think it s a showcase of the 2 ways a person can think teach  On one side  you have the idealization  You favor optimism and focus on  how it s supposed to look like  vs   how it is   A method which is indeed good  as children need to learn what s good to later learn  this is bad   Meanwhile  on the other side  you have the realistic approach  This one favours pessimism nihilism a little more  but not out of bad favour  It s knowing that the world isn t ideal  Actually  the world is going to kill you in many ways  And if you don t get used to a certain level   without actually diving into abuse     you will crash and get more hurt  Nice words and talks sometimes don t cut it  Nice words and  this shouldn t be  often do not cut it   Of course  these views can sometimes crash  Good example   A series of unfortunate events   The book series TV show was is still often highly dependant on how you grew up  If you grew up with healthy adults  you will find the show absurd  The fact that nearly no adult helps the children  some even actively sell them out etc  sounds like a really bad message for kids   Don t have hope  Don t ask for help   However  if you grew up with abusive parents in the system   this is just reality  And it actually teaches you to have hope throughout it all  Because that s how life is  Many adults don t give a fuck  but as long as you have yourself  you re not completely lost   However  I also think that you re a bit overdramatic with conflating a racist insult on paper  to literally show tiny children the depictions of other children sent to fucking die  Like   Jesus  Racism can be very traumatizing  yes  but this comparison goes to far  The parasocial connection and damage would be way greater objectively  Jesus ;1619

2474;2023-05-29 22:52:00;1.0;So  do you want children s books to be modernised  Because otherwise the consequence could be exposing them to real Anti Semitic views in books  without explanation  and then not using any of the books that are already used to teach about the Holocaust   the consequence of Anti Semitism  Frankly  I think that might make the fact that our UK schools still insist on teaching The Boy in the Striped Pajamas  inaccurate and grossly misleading  look like the lesser evil   The topic of WWII and Holocaust remembrance are prevalent enough in our society that it s likely enough children will have heard about it before it s covered in school  certainly before being shown photographs  It can be discussed in an age appropriate way ;44

2515;2023-05-29 03:16:00;30.0;After finishing Sphere  Andromeda Strain was highly recommended to me as my next Crichton read  I just finished it and well  I was underwhelmed   The premise is amazing and though I didn t connect with any of the characters  i found them all effective for the plot and fine enough  My issue was   the book just kind of ended  Like  things are moving along and scientists are underground dealing with a deadly organism from space only to have it mutate to eat rubber instead and hey everything is okay now     After the ending in Sphere  the ending in Strain really fell flat for me  I also felt the book broke off into science discussion and history far too often    Am I alone feeling this way ;1555
2516;2023-05-29 20:17:00;13.0;No  not alone  But I guess that was the point of the ending  Like Raiders of the Lost Ark   the characters are witnesses  but they don t shape the final event   Though I did wonder why they were so sure that it wouldn t mutate to something that was harmful again    I thoroughly enjoyed the science discussion parts  A lot more comprehensible than when Robert A  Heinlein would do it ;981
2517;2023-05-29 07:27:00;6.0;Most of Crichton s novels are pop science warnings about playing around with things we don t fully understand  As a result  the characters are often just witnesses trying to survive the event  Not masters of events that  defeat  the bad guy because it would defeat the purpose of making the point that they re not in control and that s why bad things happen ;59
2518;2023-05-29 04:34:00;5.0;That s a common theme with Crichton s books   You can see exactly the point he was done telling the story and shifted to  wrap it up  mode   He s a great story teller  but a terrible story ender;1748
2519;2023-05-29 13:43:00;3.0;Yeah I felt the same way when I was reading it  Like I was at the part where he s climbing the ladder and I realized I had very few pages left and was like  oh this is supposed to be the climax  I believe Andromeda Strain was one of if not his first novel so he was clearly still figuring his style out ;2216
2520;2023-06-02 07:52:00;2.0;My favorite author  by far  Don t miss The Great Train Robbery and Airframe ;319
2521;2023-05-29 10:08:00;2.0;It s been a while since I ve read this  but  I don t think any Crichton book I ve read has really amazing characters  Interesting ideas  cool science  great suspense  yes   but the characters are all clearly vehicles for that ;2415
2522;2023-05-29 05:11:00;2.0;I know what you mean  but I did kind of like the ending after a while  It builds up the drama a lot and it s frankly hopeless for the scientists and humanity at some point   to have it all just go right for everyone at end feels too good to be true though     edit  also try Prey if you want something like Andromeda Strain that is similar but different ;1118
2523;2023-05-29 05:10:00;1.0;I absolutely loved the book when I was 14  Reread it last year  about 30 years later  Same parts still drew me in  But its not as good as some of his other stuff  I think it was one of his first novels  perhaps THE first  so you can probably forgive him for some stuff    I think his best novels are Jurrasic Park and The Great Train Robbery  Have had no desire to reread Disclosure or Prey  I also rather enjoyed Pirate Latitudes  although that one was completed after his death ;1561
2524;2023-05-29 03:26:00;1.0;Part of me loved how optimistic it was ;497
2525;2023-05-29 05:33:00;1.0;I think Andromeda Strain was the book that got me into science fiction    I agree that the ending is a little abrupt  but I loved the indulging passages about science and history  I was not only been entertained by a good story  but also learning something new about history and science as well   I have also read the Sphere  and I think it s really good  It broke a little my willing suspension of disbelief  but still awesome and recommendable  I will have to read the other books mentioned in this thread ;1551
2526;2023-05-29 05:11:00;1.0;I felt the same way  I loved Sphere  so I figured I would keep the Crichton train rolling with Andromeda Strain  I flew through it because the buildup was captivating  And then suddenly   fart noise    The ending was a pretty big let down  Then I learned that there s a sequel  so I can t help but wonder if this abrupt ending wasn t planned that way  as flat as it ended up being ;1349
2527;2023-05-29 06:07:00;2.0;To me there are horror elements to the story that aren t really highlighted  Unfit team members that endanger humanity due to ego  Racks of animals to experiment on  The containment of the impeccably designed facility is defeated by people and by the pathogen    The ending is a realistic scenario in that we got lucky and not enough will be done to avert future catastrophe  The world faced huge threats with SARS  H1n1 and Zika  yet when Covid 19 came we were unprepared to fight it and to take basic measurements to protect each other  Excerpt from a 2020 BBC com article   BBC com  https   www bbc com future article 20200918 why some deadly viruses vanish and go extinct   Like its close relative Covid 19  Sars had many of the necessary qualities for world domination   it was an RNA virus  meaning it was able to evolve rapidly  and it was spread through droplets expelled when breathing  which are hard to avoid  At the time  many experts were concerned that the virus could cause devastation on the same level as the HIV crisis  or even the 1918 flu pandemic  which infected a third of the world s population and killed 50 million    Instead  Sars disappeared as abruptly as it arrived  By January 2004  there were just a handful of cases   and by the end of month  the last suspected natural infection was announced  Oddly  while  patient zero  describes the first known person to be infected with a virus  there is no equivalent label for the last ever person to catch it in the wild  But this would arguably apply to a 40 year old man with the family name of  Liu  from the southern city of Guangzhou   There was another outbreak a couple of months later  when it is thought to have escaped from a Beijing research lab   twice     So what happened    In a nutshell  we got lucky ;865
2528;2023-05-29 14:19:00;1.0;I still skip over that part in  Time Enough for Love  when Heinlein talks about genetics for a LONG time  I love that book  but I can t do that part ;666
2529;2023-05-29 05:41:00;1.0;When it comes to mutation  once it had mutated  it would have to pass from host to host   so it needs a host which is well enough to not deter others from coming in contact  to move around and spread the infection   The faster spreading virus will get to other hosts sooner and may well confer immunity ;1577
2530;2023-05-29 07:37:00;1.0;  The Great Train Robbery  This is very interesting  as of all the books of his I read  I liked this one the least     What drew you to it   Did you read the Terminal Man ;1273
2531;2023-05-29 02:08:00;1.0;The Tale of the Twins Who Weren t   Still better than his engineering spiels  Those always make me feel stupid ;1760
2532;2023-05-29 03:30:00;350.0;For those who haven t read it  it is a brief and short novel about a young girl named Coraline  She finds a door in her house that is bricked off  and when she finds that door with the bricks mysteriously gone  she goes through to the other side  What she finds is an alternate version of her home  but one that is eerily perfect and has alternate copies of her parents that are too eager to have her stay there  Coraline leaves  but she finds that the other mother has kidnapped her real parents  so Coraline goes back into the alternate world to save them    I ve read a few Neil Gaiman books now  but this is the first one that I ve read that wasn t targeted towards adults  It s a little strange how his writing didn t feel less mature  it instead felt similar to his other novels  but much more brief and skimping on details he would have otherwise included  It s also baffling that he wrote this at the same time as  American Gods   which I m in the middle of as well   because that and  Coraline  couldn t be further apart in tone and content  I really enjoyed this book  and I d recommend it to those who are interested in it with the caveat that it is aimed at younger audiences   I have some thoughts regarding it  and Neil s writing in general     Coraline  feels very similar to  The Ocean at the End of the Lane   They both share a quality that I can t quite put my finger on  but it s almost like  The Ocean at the End of the Lane  was written to be a similar story for adult audiences  One to read when you re young  the other to read when you re reminiscing on being young    I have a tendency to envision  male  talking animals to sound like Keith David  so when I found out the cat was voiced by Keith David in the movie adaptation  I actually laughed  10 10 casting     Much like  The Hobbit   I wish I actually read this as a child  That being said  I can t wait to give either this book or  The Hobbit  to my future children and experience that childhood wonder through them     This is one of the few books that I ve read in a single day  It s a great detox book when you need a day to take a break from your other books hobbies ;2126
2533;2023-05-29 02:23:00;366.0;My favorite story about Coraline is that his editor thought it was too scary for children  so he  Gaiman asked her to take it home and read it to her eight year old daughter  The editor did  and while she was reading she kept asking her daughter if it was too scary and the daughter kept saying it wasn t  Years later  Gaiman met the daughter and asked her about it  and she said she was actually terrified  but she really wanted to hear the end ;2370
2534;2023-05-29 03:28:00;34.0;It s great hearing him read it ;2375
2535;2023-05-29 18:11:00;13.0;Yup  Coraline is a fun read for all ages  When they made the movie  I liked that they were bold enough to deviate from the book to get the visuals and storytelling to work in a more movie like way  And Keith David kills it as the voice of the cat  he s awesome in the Princess and the Frog also ;375
2536;2023-05-29 04:09:00;9.0;Look up the short story The Pear Drum  It s  or a variation of it  supposed to be an inspiration for the book  It s a very short story and thought the abrupt ending made it scary despite the brevity ;1303
2537;2023-05-29 08:15:00;7.0;The Thief Of Always is a great read ;781
2538;2023-05-30 02:38:00;17.0;Coraline is a wonderful example of  kids books that don t pander to kids     Kids are able to read and enjoy artful writing  Sadly  they don t often get the chance to because so much modern YA writing is pablum  The same  hero s quest  story told over and over again  in simple prose that isn t challenging or particularly interesting   I m a big fan of Gaiman in general  and I love the fact that he has a few books that I can give to my 10 year old without fear of scarring him for life  or exposing him to adult concepts that he isn t quite ready for yet   Terry Pratchett is another author who has impressed me with his ability to write  for  kids without writing  down to  kids  My son and I read  Tiffany Aching Wee Free Men together and both of us absolutely adored it   We also loved the Lemony Snicket series  And the  all the wrong questions  spin off    These are all authors who get my respect  because they all respect kids ;139
2539;2023-05-30 13:22:00;18.0;One of my favorite horror books  I ll have to read it again sometime;1194
2540;2023-05-29 03:48:00;5.0;This was a  Battle of the Books  title when I was in 5th grade  I was 11 when I read it  and I m still surprised it was on the reading list  We had to read a certain amount of the books listed to be able to qualify for a special lunch at the end of the year  where all the kids who completed the challenge in each grade could meet to chat about the books  Coraline was by far the most discussed  It was impactful to all of us  Some kids couldn t finish it  others couldn t put it down ;1560
2541;2023-05-29 03:27:00;5.0;Best book to movie adaptation in cinematic history  hands down    As a kid I thought most horror stories for children were disappointing  because they were too silly and unrealistic for me to suspend my disbelief and actually get scared  Coraline was the first book that ever gave me nightmares ;368
2542;2023-05-29 02:17:00;3.0;If you have the chance I recommend the audiobook of Neil reading it  It s lovely ;110
2543;2023-05-29 15:26:00;3.0;Have you seen the movie Mirror Mask by Neil Gaiman and Dave McKeon  Definitely some parallels in that movie ;534
2544;2023-05-29 15:52:00;3.0;This is one of the few books where I actually think the movie is better  They did an amazing job with it;643
2545;2023-05-29 02:39:00;3.0;I love Coraline  You should also try Neil s The Graveyard Book  It s targeted toward kids as well but it s a great read for both adults and kids;667
2546;2023-05-29 03:26:00;6.0;The book is fantastic and genuinely scary  The scene where she finds her Other Dad and he s essentially decomposing is nightmare fuel  Neil Gaimans writing is also just 11 10 for me;807
2547;2023-05-29 18:53:00;5.0;Sucks that wybie wasn t in the book  Missed him  But loved the extra bits and the whole different creature that is her other dad ;1543
2548;2023-05-29 21:49:00;2.0;I loved it ;2168
2549;2023-05-29 01:31:00;2.0;It s such a great book  Loved the cat haha ;1820
2550;2023-05-29 01:17:00;2.0;brief and short ;1193
2551;2023-05-29 02:16:00;2.0;I haven t read the book  but I have seen and loved the film  potentially my favourite stop motion film to date ;1156
2552;2023-05-29 01:42:00;2.0;You may be interested in  The New Mother  by Lucy Lane Clifford from 1882  a short story which Gaiman cites as inspiration for  Coraline     Quoting from  The Oxford Book of Modern Fairy Tales  by Alison Lurie      The author was a good friend of Henry James  and it has been suggested that  The New Mother  may be one of the sources of  The Turn of the Screw   ;492
2553;2023-05-29 08:11:00;2.0;I much prefer the book to the movie ;1843
2554;2023-05-29 19:14:00;2.0;I absolutely hated  The Ocean at the End of the Lane    Things just happened in the book  and there were no rules and no context for any of the magical events  and no real understanding of why the magical characters were powerful or the limit of their powers   I rather enjoyed Coraline because it seemed a lot easier to understand  and ultimately the main character was responsible for their own salvation  not some mysterious other power ;749
2555;2023-05-29 08:02:00;1.0;Gaiman paints brilliant pictures that the imagination can latch on to  Just enough fantasy  just enough fear  just enough reality    My kids are both teens now  they still remember me reading this to them ;1763
2556;2023-05-29 06:54:00;1.0;Coraline is one of my favorite stories to this day  I was always a fan of the likes of Goosebumps as a kid in the 90 s  but Coraline absolutely captivated me  Movie was great too ;348
2557;2023-05-29 04:59:00;-10.0;When I read this book  I couldn t help but think of Alice in Wonderland  which I enjoyed much more than Coraline   My biggest issue with the book was with Coraline herself  I found her infuriating  especially at the beginning of the book  To me  she came off as a whiny little brat  and this feeling of detest towards the character lingered throughout the story  Ruining the reading experience for me ;2039
2558;2023-06-01 13:50:00;1.0;I know Neil gailman is the goat and all but fuck him for the coraline movie for haunting my childhood;2330
2559;2023-05-30 02:29:00;-1.0;I read it a bit too late  in late middle early high school  but I found it kinda boring overall  I was a big fan of Gaiman back then  not so much now   but unlike other children s books like Seuss or Little Prince  Coraline doesn t offer much to adults  imo  I can see why kids would like it but I can also think of better books to read to kids   On the other hand maybe I was just getting bored of Gaiman by then ;242
2560;2023-05-29 10:30:00;0.0;I enjoyed Coraline too  but I really  really loved The Ocean    Soon as I finished it  I had to go back and re read the first chapter  He set it up so well  He s probably my mouse favorite modern writers for his world building and language    There s one particular sentence in the Ocean where a crush  first kiss and the said character leaves forever  all in one single sentence  I think it was done masterfully  Not marking it as a spoiler since it really has no bearing on the story per se ;1399
2561;2023-05-29 01:29:00;0.0;Ugh  it s so wonderful ;1659
2562;2023-05-29 16:42:00;150.0;The best part about all of this is that  at it s core  Coraline is a book about overcoming your fears  So even if kids find it very scary  by completing it they re overcoming their own fears which I think is very self fulfilling and wonderful ;744
2563;2023-05-29 05:24:00;35.0;I haven t heard that before  I should try to look up the full story  because that sounds very entertaining ;695
2564;2023-05-29 19:40:00;6.0;lol i love that;2064
2565;2023-05-29 10:49:00;2.0;I was about 11 when I read it  and I  still  have nightmares about the hand and well   I m 31 now  ;224
2566;2023-05-29 10:44:00;1.0;My aunt gave me this book and I read the whole thing and it was way to scary for me  gave me nightmares  But I am an adult and I still can t watch scary movies so I think I m just not the person to read this kind of thing;2443
2567;2023-05-29 08:08:00;26.0;Yes  I just checked it out of my local library and was pleasantly surprised to hear him reading it  Sometimes it isn t a good idea for authors to read  narrate   their own works as audio books  but he has an knack for the  acting  part of it ;1078
2568;2023-05-29 01:35:00;6.0;A quote from one of my favourite children s authors   You have to write the book that wants to be written  And if the book will be too difficult for grown ups  then you write it for children     Madeline L Engle;1096
2569;2023-05-29 05:35:00;2.0;Was this also a book   Id love to read it  The whole film was an acid trip;2399
2570;2023-05-29 11:23:00;16.0;Kids are whiny little brats though it s representative   If I was a kid and I was stuck in the midday of nowhere with a bunch of weird people and no one my own age I d go insane ;1377
2571;2023-05-29 13:40:00;3.0;  she came off as a whiny little brat    So  a realistic depiction of how kids can be ;1485
2572;2023-05-29 05:45:00;1.0;Did you first read the book as an adult  I suppose I might feel similar to the way you do now if I were to read it again  but as a child reading the novel I found her quite sympathetic ;1835
2573;2023-05-29 21:45:00;54.0;I read Coraline soon after it came out  and there s a line that s always stuck with me  It s something like    I will be brave   thought Coraline   No  I  am  brave   ;263
2574;2023-05-29 07:46:00;24.0;https   ew com article 2010 10 06 5584 ;1545
2575;2023-05-29 00:28:00;32.0;Gaiman is one of those authors who speaks in the same prose that he writes with  so he really is perfect to narrate his own works;1529
2576;2023-05-29 00:40:00;7.0;Yes  he s one of the few  Another is Michael Chabon reading Summerland  Really excellent  There are more nonfiction authors who can do a good job  but not all of them ;22
2577;2023-05-29 00:25:00;5.0;The Redwall audiobooks they were able to complete are excellent with the author as the narrator  He has the perfect voice for a passionate grandpa telling bedtime yarns ;2042
2578;2023-05-30 02:02:00;15.0;Agree  she s in a terrible circumstance for a kid  so of course she s going to be upset  Her parents ignore her  nobody can remember how to say her name  she has nothing to do all day in the middle of nowhere  You instantly feel bad for her imo ;1788
2579;2023-05-29 01:50:00;-10.0;Yeah  I just compared her character with Alice  who I found much more attractive as a character  she made me laugh out loud numerous times despite how other characters treated her  If I read Coraline first  I wouldn t be as harsh on it as I am  To me  Gaiman just wrote a more inferior version of Alice in Wonderland ;1086
2580;2023-05-29 04:20:00;0.0;Yes  The author intentionally wrote the character this way as he was going for a realistic representation of kids that age  I don t see why this means I should automatically like the book  Some of my favourite reads are about young kids in fantastical settings  like The BFG and Matilda by Roahl Dahl   With both of these  I don t have any issues with the main characters  just like I don t with Alice in Wonderland or even something like Pan s Labyrinth by Del Torro  I found all the main characters in these stories delightful to spend time with while they are on their journeys  I can t say the same for Coraline  That s not a popular take  but I m sharing my experience with the book ;2197
2581;2023-05-29 00:20:00;12.0;Well done  Redditor ;2283
2582;2023-05-29 00:46:00;7.0;Two other spring to mind    King narrated some of his books   And Douglas Adams as well ;423
2583;2023-05-29 02:04:00;20.0;The ending left me in shock but I also feel kind of sad     Spolier  I really liked the real Adele and to find out she s been dead for a long time was so chilling but interesting  I can t believe Rob really took over her body  Earlier on in the story he seemed kinda sweet  or maybe I didnt see the hints about his true personaity    I thought he loved Adele but he actually loved David  Omg and poor Louise and Adam  I wonder if Adam will be able to uncover the truth as he gets older  Or maybe David will ;572
2584;2023-05-29 06:20:00;5.0;I loved this book  I read a lot of Lois Duncan books when I was in middle school  one of which    Stranger With My Face  involves astral projection too    so it was comfy to see it in this book     The adaptation of Behind Her Eyes on Netflix is quite good   ;257
2585;2023-05-29 08:01:00;5.0;I hate it when they shift the genre out of nowhere  Though this was a well written book  I didn t like the way it ended  Imagine a twist like Jake Brigance in  A time to kill  was from the future and that s why he had such a forward mindset  Would you expect it  Ofcourse not     This book follows a similar yet a glorified illogical twist for a well setup premise ;2130
2586;2023-05-29 09:13:00;2.0;That ending really came out of nowhere didnt it  absolutely no clue in any of the first 90  of the book or any of the marketing that it was going to turn out to be supernatural  I was sort of annoyed  but at the same time it was written well enough that I forgave it   The tv adaptation was pretty good  even when you know the twist ;1795
2587;2023-05-29 09:57:00;1.0;I couldn t stand David  personally  and it was painful to see him be such an asshole with 2 people    3 people     falling all over him ;1311
2588;2023-05-29 12:16:00;1.0;There s a David cameo in the epilogue of Pinborough s newest release  Insomnia ;2108
2589;2023-05-29 15:18:00;5.0;I didn t like it at all  There was no possible way the reader could have deduced what was going on  I was annoyed because I realised I wasn t enjoying it  but the curiosity regarding  the big twist  kept me from DNFing  Then it was a supernatural thing   stupid ;157
2590;2023-05-29 16:26:00;4.0;I would have to disagree  I think the stuff about   astral projection and possession   was well signposted right from the start  I d certainly managed to work it out very early in the book and got a little thrill the further I read and the more everything lined up  But that final twist really took me by surprise   It may have helped that I d read a couple of other Pinborough books before and they both had a slight magical realism feel to them ;204
2591;2023-05-29 22:31:00;3.0;Interesting  I started reading expecting nothing more than a domestic thriller  Thanks for your comment  Made me think about how you can t see something if you aren t looking ;824
2592;2023-05-29 23:24:00;3.0;Yeah  and I think that s where a lot of people s annoyance comes from  It was sold as a straight up thriller  and it was her first book in that genre so readers may not have been aware of her past work  It must have felt to a lot of people that they were duped into reading something they weren t expecting   But there s also no way to pre warn readers without giving away a huge part of the story ;1866
2593;2023-05-29 23:54:00;7.0;Reading this book  about halfway through  I know I should finish reading before bringing this up  but I can t help but to get the discussion going  Has anyone else found some of the examples used to defend the oh so prevalent  default to truth  theory a little thin  Specifically when talking about transparency and  The Friends Fallacy   I do get his point at large but also  couldn t the judge that let the potential murder  man who s gun jammed when trying to shoot his ex girlfriend  not just be that he naively bought a  remorse  narrative from defendant s facial expressions  but all sorts of rationalizations rooted in sexism  a women s life not as important as a man s  that could be occurring even subconsciously in that judge s mind  I find it hard to believe also that judges  after decades of experience  could fall so easily for a  sad  remorseful  face  I find the examples to be sort of brushing over the inherent sexism that could be at play  I see the angle  this is why we victim blame  because it is human nature to believe that the simple answer is most likely the right answer  and well liked people getting accused of pedophilia is not a simple answer  Eager to hear other s thoughts around this ;607
2594;2023-05-30 01:24:00;7.0;I agree with you  spot on  I read this book earlier this year and got the same impression  And his interpretation of the Sandra Bland story really bothered me ;2262
2595;2023-05-29 01:04:00;14.0;most people feel nothing gladwell writes is worth reading or discussing  he s not a quality author ;1043
2596;2023-05-29 23:59:00;4.0;So in your view a woman whose gun jammed when trying to shoot her ex boyfriend would be treated more harshly  I tend to think the opposite ;241
2597;2023-05-29 05:30:00;1.0;Gladwell is glorified clickbait  All of his arguments are incredibly thin if you know anything about the subject  or even if you don t   His books are the equivalent of those articles titled  Everything You Know About  X  is Wrong ;58
2598;2023-06-07 22:37:00;3.0;I don t know if it s most people but I m definitely one of them;231
2599;2023-05-28 23:49:00;1.0;Interesting   i m more trying to point out that he s making arguments for transparency and face reading not working on the judge s part but not really acknowledging that many more biases could be at play;933
2600;2023-05-28 23:32:00;7.0;I think you re giving Gladwell more credit for thought process than he might deserve    He s a hack ;1784
2601;2023-05-29 00:06:00;1.0;A hack  How come  Just wondering;365
2602;2023-05-30 01:12:00;4.0;He s a good writer who can create the impression of some kind of compelling narrative   But he s a story teller  by his own admission  A story teller  not a writer dedicated to truth and fact    The reviews on some of his books  by people who actually know what they re talking about  and who use research and data properly  are   let s say not generous    In his own words    You re of necessity simplifying   says Gladwell   If you re in the business of translating ideas in the academic realm to a general audience  you have to simplify   If my books appear to a reader to be oversimplified  then you shouldn t read them  you re not the audience     This review of  The Bomber Mafia  is not atypical of many of the criticisms of his writing  https   newrepublic com article 162624 malcolm gladwells fantasy war air bomber mafia review;1701
2603;2023-06-04 05:39:00;0.0;Seems like every time I go to my local shops  they ve devoutly stocked almost all of Neil Gaiman s novels but there s never anything new  just endless reprints of his back catalogue with new covers  He s does seem like the go to guy for book intros and cover blurbs  him and Stephen King  but King is consistently putting out new and generally interesting stuff  I see no such evolution with Gaiman  I know he s got a huge and loyal following  I was one of them for awhile  but it s odd to me how his output drops off around 2017 2018  I would totally check out a new NG adult novel but seems like that ship has sailed  hit an iceberg and sunk  And the reprints and adaptations are fine  they ll always be new for someone  I suppose  Thoughts  Not aiming to be antagonistic  I respect and admire his work  I m just surprised there haven t been new novels or short stories published in recent years ;126
2604;2023-05-29 00:42:00;45.0;As someone mentioned the TV stuff there s also the Norse Mythology comic series he s been steadily releasing since 2020 that have been collected into three graphic novels of which number 3 either just came out or is about to ;924
2605;2023-05-29 06:51:00;61.0;He s been quite heavily involved in TV stuff recently with Sandman  American Gods and Good Omens series ;1445
2606;2023-06-07 23:10:00;8.0;I believe he is  was   working on a sequel to Neverwhere called The Seven Sisters  but there haven t been any recent updates sadly ;281
2607;2023-05-29 00:03:00;40.0;Gaiman has already cemented his legacy  he s an esteemed author even if he never releases another book  Having to release new books to stay relevant is for the newer generations ;388
2608;2023-05-28 23:45:00;14.0;I can t really understand readers who think authors owe them to churn out work continuously    Neil Gaiman is far from  done  even if he had only written a couple of short novels 20 years ago  a good writer is never  done  just because YOU wanted more ;1163
2609;2023-05-29 00:49:00;3.0;Why would esteem for an author diminish once they reach the end of their career ;602
2610;2023-05-30 01:17:00;5.0;I ve talked about this for the past decade or so  but Gaiman has seemingly become intent on doing  anything  other than writing another novel  Which sucks for me  and lots of other people I ve spoken to   because that s pretty much the only thing I m interested in him doing    Don t get me wrong  he s currently keeping  busy   The problem is that it all feels like a lot of masturbatory  easy income generating time wasters based on his existing IP  or otherwise easily forgettable fuck around projects    Every time I see an announcement from him and hope it s a new novel it ends up being an announcement of a radio play based on one his books  or a new illustrated children s book based on bedtime songs he sang to his kids  or a graphic novel adaptation of some short stories he did 30 years ago  or some weird spoken word live performance with music by his wife  or some Sandman related compendium  or an art book about his West End show that he wrote the forward for  or any other fucking thing that isn t an actual novel  I kind of gave up on the idea of him still being a novelist years ago ;1707
2611;2023-06-04 17:45:00;3.0;Never really liked his books  The comics were great though ;1832
2612;2023-05-29 01:01:00;1.0;Add the fact he s a dad ;851
2613;2023-05-29 16:10:00;1.0;He s doing a Miracleman comic right now ;301
2614;2023-05-29 01:03:00;-10.0;King still writes  Thought He was too busy crying on Twitter about Trump  Musk and gun control  You rarely see anything else by him ;389
2615;2023-05-29 11:19:00;3.0;Also  the graphic novel version of  Chivalry  just came out last year to great acclaim;989
2616;2023-05-29 22:38:00;13.0;Also a music album that released this year;111
2617;2023-05-29 01:11:00;7.0;I saw him at a Q A in Austin last year  He confirmed that he s writing a novel called  The Seven Sisters  and will retire from filmmaking within the next few years to focus on writing full time again ;1567
2618;2023-05-29 11:49:00;1.0;I thought writers write because they like to write and know how to write  Not because they  want to stay relevant   And what s this  writing new books is for newer generations  BS  A book a year deal has been the usual deal in the publication industry for ages ;1193
2619;2023-05-30 00:13:00;1.0;I didn t mean to suggest it would or should  I ve edited the original post to shed my poorly chosen words in that respect ;1477
2620;2023-05-29 02:36:00;8.0;Heavens forbid someone make their mark  even make a bunch of money doing it  and then pursue passion projects for the rest of their lives   He s also actively involved in all the adaptations of his own works  ensuring it remains true to his vision for what it should be    Neil Gaiman make more things      Neil Gaiman makes things     No  not like that  Only make things  I  like  not what  you  like  ;2308
2621;2023-05-29 02:31:00;1.0;Yes  I think this is what I was grasping for  His brand  for a long time  has been Make Good Art and yep  he s busy for sure but my perception is that he s largely about film and TV adaptations and riding the wave of reprints  Artists wanna get paid  I totally get it  I write and it s laughable how little I get from it so good on him making the big bucks but I m seeing less and less of the art he so vociferously champions  That said  as another poster said  he doesn t owe us anything  Just  cause we want a new book doesn t make him beholden to anyone  I guess it s all that talk of making good art that sold me while it seems like  and I may be quite wrong here   that he s more invested in making big business decisions than creative ones ;2445
2622;2023-05-29 12:00:00;2.0;Same ;2056
2623;2023-05-30 01:04:00;10.0;Well clearly I need to pay more attention  The TV stuff was obvious to me but I wandered away from comics awhile back  The music is utterly new to me ;261
2624;2023-05-29 02:55:00;13.0;I was responding to OPs comment   I can t align the god like esteem he s still held to with a lack of new published work   That statement alone says to me that they think Gaiman doesn t deserve esteem because he hasn t published for a while  which is trash talk    To me legacy writers don t need to publish every few years    Not all writers are the same or have the same goals and aspirations  Writing doesn t just have to be for free because you like it  If you want it to be a job  consistency both in quality   output is key  unless you have one book that is lightening in a bottle and sells millions  and even then success   esteem isn t guaranteed ;509
2625;2023-05-29 03:47:00;3.0;You see  I understand this too  It s a fine  weird line to walk with artists we admire  Gaiman has cultivated such a huge fan base  written some truly stellar stuff  it s hard to let it go  It s the eternal question  what does the artist owe their fans and or critics  Nothing at all perhaps  The adaptations and whatnot don t appeal to me but if that s where he s at  who am I to scold him for it  My difficulty with this may be part of a bigger problem with the popular cultural landscape in general  where intellectual properties and franchises are milked to death for decades  lurching along zombie like  Art becomes artifice  Everything old is rebooted  repackaged  what have you  Maybe it s as simple as craving something new and some of us lay that at the feet of artists like Gaiman  perhaps unfairly  who once was the fresh and brilliant new thing but who has now earned their right to indulge vanity projects and opportunities  Maybe I ve got it backwards  maybe Gaiman has evolved but me  as a once big fan  has not ;745
2626;2023-05-29 03:44:00;5.0;I never said how dare he  or that he s not allowed to do it  or that he should stop  I m just saying that I don t personally give a shit about any of those things ;1037
2627;2023-05-29 03:50:00;1.0;Good Omens ;928
2628;2023-05-29 11:06:00;19.0;If you ve read diary of an oxygen thief please let me know what you think of it     Did you like it   I personally felt indifferent about the book   it wasn t neither captivating but it was not boring  I definitely feel like the book is something you kinda have to prepare yourself for because the intense language and plus scenarios in the book are tough    What did you think about the main character   The main character seemed to be well off   Of course it highlights his own personal mental illness i feel like it could ve been better if he did something to actively work on it instead if of just AA  What did you like dislike  I Disliked the chaos in every page and if it wasn t chaos it was just complaining about the most bizarre mundane things     I recently just finished it and wanna share my thoughts amongst others  ;2295
2629;2023-05-29 06:14:00;3.0;I absolutely hated that book    when I finished it  I just kinda felt like  so what   ya know   I went to school with at least ten dudes just as pathetic  I don t feel inclined to revisit the book or any conversations with such sad men  ;692
2630;2023-05-29 11:48:00;2.0;I enjoyed it  it made me angry  and the payoff was a little unsubstantial   Early on one of the scenarios made me look away from the page in a way that even descriptively graphic books like American Psycho didn t couldn t   I m glad I read it but it was perfectly whelming ;2050
2631;2023-05-29 11:47:00;15.0;I sometimes try to avoid reading books that have been reviewed exceptionally well or have the  classic  designation  It s partly because I become very impatient with these books   Maybe it started in high school where I was forced to read various books that were considered classics but which I hated  So maybe even as an adult  those memories are shaping my choices    It s like a meal that somebody says is the best they ve ever had  Or a restaurant they say is among the best  So you go in there and right away think the waiter is taking too long to come to your table  or a particular appetizer does not taste so good  or maybe the prices are way too high  In short  you are quick to feel disappointed   Of course  I don t want to pick a random book either  because there are like  what  over a million books published every year  just guessing   and I don t want to waste time reading something that is not well written or is not about a topic that interests me at all   So what I do is sort of go somewhere in the middle  pick a book that got some positive reviews  and I read to make sure it is a topic of potential interest  then I start reading   Anyhow  I totally feel like my expectations are ruining my reading experience  I envy people who are so open minded and read widely and give books a chance  I really wish I could one day be like that ;2171
2632;2023-05-29 03:53:00;5.0;It must be exhausting;1108
2633;2023-05-29 05:50:00;4.0;I give everything as much a chance as I can stand until I feel the book has had enough time to speak to me  It s very nebulous  but it helps that I know I often dislike books at the beginning  but enjoy them by the middle  I don t sweat a rough start  but if I still don t want to crack the book open after reading a decent chunk of it  I don t fight it  I ll set the book aside   With expectations  it really depends  I put more stock in the opinions of close friends with similar tastes  or  if I m trying to broaden my tastes  the opinion of a friend with an informed opinion  I generally avoid  big  books so I can feel more surprised  but sometimes the  big  books can still surprise me ;921
2634;2023-05-30 11:33:00;9.0;I am interested in nothing but the ride ;1912
2635;2023-05-29 04:18:00;2.0;My expectation is that the author appropriately uses punctuation  Nothing bothers me more than having to reread sentences to get the meaning because the author has never heard of a comma  It totally breaks my flow ;1149
2636;2023-05-30 04:10:00;1.0;I have a problem where I automatically hate books people are hyping    So I try to know very very little about any book I read  Basically only the genre  cover  and if it is an uncompleted series  Less expectations I have the better ;1070
2637;2023-05-31 10:41:00;0.0;Considering I have ADHD and can t understand almost any social constructs and standards  I have always been pretty open minded  Except for spreading hatred and bigotry  I rarely find it difficult to take on different opinions   However I agree with you  Most mainstream books are usually really mediocre ;147
2638;2023-06-08 23:17:00;1.0;I m newly back into reading  so keep that in mind with this response    Sometimes I find a book based on people raving about it online  and I ll pick it up  The best example of this recently is Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros  which I am going to start reading tomorrow  On the other side of the coin  I like to go to book shops and look around  see what the staff recommends  see what catches my eye  and just buy a book that way  I won t even look up the reviews of it  because  I want that open minded view of it  I find it a bit more fun that way  I m actually apprehensive about diving into Fourth Wing because people online have set my expectations so high  We ll see    So  am I aware of particular expectations  Yes and no  I find it more fun to not be aware of them though  I think ;1096
2639;2023-05-29 04:00:00;1.0;I only pay attention to 3 star reviews and sometimes 4s   2s  if at all    I try not to have any expectations but it s kind of impossible to have none   Books for school are for education purposes  you don t have to enjoy them just understand them  For entertainment it s a bit harder to pick what you re more likely to enjoy  but I think keeping an open mind is beneficial  You re not the same person you were in high school   I think the more you read the more you learn what you like and what you don t like so it gets easier to choose the more you try different things ;1219
2640;2023-06-01 15:18:00;1.0;I don t read reviews at all  I guarantee I can find people who hate what I love and vice versa    I tend to choose books that either caught my eye on Reddit or that will fulfill a prompt for a reading challenge  I go in blind on a lot of books and have been pleasantly surprised a lot more often than disappointed    I m currently reading fiction and nonfiction books by authors from 195 countries  just finding something from an author from any country that my library has is hard enough so I m not being very selective  I have read some amazing books  but I m also very willing to DNF any thing that becomes frustrating to read ;2138
2641;2023-05-29 05:07:00;1.0;I like to figure out what others liked about a book as I read it  I also like thinking about why I might not have liked a book  I can acknowledge that things can be well written  even if they re not my preference   Sometimes it takes time for me to start enjoying a book  That s ok  Sometimes the book isn t the problem  it s me  I try to approach books on their own terms rather than  impose a rigid idea of what a good book looks like to all genres and styles  Different books are loved for different reasons ;946
2642;2023-05-30 04:53:00;1.0;Well    I never pick up books I have absolutely no expectation  that s for sure  I will never read a book I don t expect to be good   I read everything   any genre  any author  give it to me  But if I m not into the theme or the premise  or if it s widely considered a bad book  why will I waste my time with it  Unless I m very curious to see what the fuss is all about ;215
2643;2023-05-31 14:18:00;1.0;I have enough of a personal preference to form my own opinion about books that have a lot of hype or hate surrounding it  That said  I would not have an opinion about the content of books i have not read ;574
2644;2023-06-09 02:43:00;1.0;Pretty open   I choose book based on the cover first and short description second  just to know more or less what it is about   I don t care about genre  unless it s horror   lenght  hype  etc ;1189
2645;2023-05-29 12:50:00;1.0;Nobody sets out to make a bad or disappointing product  so I m as open minded as I can be ;1593
2646;2023-05-31 15:12:00;1.0;I rarely read current books  I generally go into books completely naive as to what it s going to be about ;1638
2647;2023-05-29 13:10:00;1.0;I don t really pay attention to how open minded or not I am when I pick up a new book  I feel how I feel  and it s a book  not a person  you know  My first impressions don t determine whether I read the book or not  though ;1992
2648;2023-05-31 15:19:00;1.0;I can definitely relate in terms of being forced to read  and over analyse   classic  texts as a teenager  please  no one talk to me about  The Outsiders   ever   I find many  classics  to be not at all to my taste and nowhere near as well written or interesting as their reputations would have you believe   Moby Dick   I m looking at you    I have similar issues with many wildly popular recent books   the type that show up on Oprah Winfred s lists  say  or NY Times bestseller lists for months on end  But   I don t think it s necessarily that these books fail to live up to expectations  or even that they re bad books  I ve discovered some amazing books and authors by reading reviews  ones that absolutely lived up to all the hype  Eg  I can t remember the name of the reviewer who put me on to  Assassin s Apprentice  by Robin Hobb  but that book   and all the others following it   absolutely lived up to my expectations       I think maybe it s a matter of ensuring that you find reviewers and recommendations that match what you personally love to read ;764
2649;2023-05-28 20:34:00;1.0;I refrain from review external opinions from the book prior to reading  They may themselves be biased and divisive at times  It s also advantageous to begin devoting one s attention to a new book without any presumptions of what it could entail ;1363
2650;2023-05-28 20:23:00;1.0;Doesn t matter to me whether a book is loved or hated if the summary sparks my fancy  I rarely go by reviews anyway   I read it and then decide what I think   Such as Babel  which seems to be loved or hated equally  If it keeps me engaged and wanting to know how it ends  I ll finish it  It s rare that I don t finish a book in less than 2 sittings  if its 400    I thoroughly loved it  even one of my SIL s students highly recommended she read it ;787
2651;2023-05-28 20:34:00;1.0;How I get my book recommendations is either from a reading list or from someone going  Oh i read  x  and I really enjoyed it   I rarely have any expectations   Which made Stephen Kings latest novel throw me for a fucking loop lemme tell ya ;786
2652;2023-05-28 20:21:00;-1.0;I m not a fan of mainstream writing  so it s hit or miss when you ride the margins  If something hasn t grabbed me within 50 pages  I m out  Too many good books to waste my reading time on stuff that doesn t resonate ;192
2653;2023-05-28 21:16:00;2.0;That s how I felt reading  In the Heart of the Sea  in college  Slow start  but after the first couple chapters it was smooth sailing  Pun not intended  Bought it again several years later   I should give  Baseball s Great Experiment  another try   I m trying to expand the number of authors and genres I read  I chose the other book my prof had given the option of  which I still half assed the essay on  called  Bread Givers  ;802
2654;2023-05-28 21:35:00;4.0;I just finished reading this Pulitzer Prize winning novel   This post isn t really about the book in general  but about its vocabulary  I ve noticed this same issue in many books I ve read  where it feels as though the writer is trying to make a point by using really obscure words  but that point is completely lost on me   In this case  the story is in first person  so are we supposed to assume that the narrator is     stuffy  Learned  Intellectual  Showy   It s really not clear  because aside from those crazy words  he s not really any of those things  He s a professor of history at a middling university  but in his conversations  he seems like a normal  slightly self effacing guy  He sort of calls out another character for using words like peripety and climacteric   But then  the narrative leaves that behind  and hits us with tons of words just like that   So what s the point  Maybe we re just supposed to think that the author is smart   I contrast this to books like Lolita  or The Debt to Pleasure  both of which I loved  where the high vocabulary and style is perfectly suited to  and complements  the character that we re learning about   Here are some of the words I mean   Cathexes  strappado  carceral  horripilation  pentimento  sudorific  pelage  pontonier   EDIT  It was actually  ponton  as in  the car was ponton    capirote  hyemal   lucubration     And then there were some that I knew  or kinda knew   but still classify them as difficult words  caudillo  nugatory  gloriole   Lastly  he used some words in a weird way  so that I looked them up just to see if there was a definition that I was missing  Unfortunately  though I remember one was  menial   I can t remember the context   Anyone else read this book and felt the way I feel   EDIT   logopoeic  propaedeutic  patriotic sentiments were emanating from her     ;380
2655;2023-05-29 02:24:00;4.0;I ve always enjoyed expanding my vocabulary  Your post made me interested in reading this book ;1656
2656;2023-05-28 20:44:00;3.0;I really liked this book  because it was so funny  But I did have the same feeling when I first read it  I actually went looking for an explanation at the time  It might just be the way Cohen writes  He probably speaks that way too    It s irked others as well  From the New York Times review of The Netanyahus     I hesitate to say it s accessible  only because of the amount of unnecessarily blue chip words that appear throughout  And here I ll take a paragraph on just this  It was unclear to me if these words appeared as a way to convey the character of Ruben Blum   maybe as a pompous professorial type  If so  it was lost on me  since the net result was the same  I lost some of the rhythm in a Sheol of internet vocabulary searches  though  to be clear  I do not cavil at these words  lest my own lesser vocabulary stick out like a carbuncle   Also  Glabrous  Cathexes  Strappado  It goes on  ;1392
2657;2023-05-28 21:13:00;5.0;I read the book and didn t notice that at all  I thoght it was a delightful book and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it ;1187
2658;2023-05-28 21:35:00;5.0;I own it but haven t read it yet   Plenty of people will says it s showing off but I try to give the benefit of the doubt in these cases  until proven otherwise    Some authors seem to just have a ridiculous vocabulary at their disposal  Phillip Freedenberg and Rick Harsch come to mind of the books I ve read recently  Used properly it can be amazing  Harsch is like no other  even Nobokov in my estimation  as far as choosing the absolute perfect word in relation to the words surrounding it  like two words together were just meant for each other   And then of course there s precision  which is more common  making use of the vast English language at their disposal   I ll admit it can be more difficult and slow things down  even less enjoyable  but in the long run I think it s a plus overall   It s just my job to grow my vocabulary and enjoy authors that introduce me to more words   I don t thing using ridiculous words is inutile but on the other hand surely some of them could do a better job of making things a bit more palatable    Super abbreviated answer   It s art   Artist s prerogative ;594
2659;2023-05-28 20:30:00;2.0;I know what those words mean  so I wouldn t consider them ridiculous ;1084

2661;2023-05-28 22:47:00;1.0;I agree to a point  Sometimes the word choice seemed a bit much  But  the structure of the story is a very old professor writing about something that happened 40  years ago  so it makes sense that there d be a dichotomy between the narration and dialogue  and the stuffy language is not unprecedented for someone who spent that much time in academia  I do understand what you re getting at  though ;634

2663;2023-05-29 01:27:00;1.0;Yeah  go for it    I like expanding my vocabulary  too  I just don t like it when it seems purposeful and I can t see the purpose  In this case  as I mentioned  the issue isn t the words  but the lack of consistency between the words and the person speaking them   It s like sex in a movie  I m not a prude  I don t mind sex if it s good for the story  If it makes sense  But when they throw it in just for ticket sales  then it bugs me ;916
2664;2023-05-29 04:46:00;2.0;Thanks  it s refreshing to have one or two people respond who actually read the book ;746
2665;2023-05-28 20:54:00;6.0;Oh  I m not saying it s a bad book  I was just talking about this one aspect   You didn t notice it  so there s my answer  Did you glide over the words I listed in the post  and others   or did you already know them  Maybe this is a  me  thing ;1975
2666;2023-05-28 20:26:00;5.0;I can assure you that it s not precision  At least  not in every case  For example  he uses hyemal as a noun  That can be art  but it s not precision  There are absolutely more precise words to use   This is a first person story  so the language should fit the character s vocabulary  rather than the author s    That s my point  really  It doesn t seem to fit the character      I ll admit it can be more difficult and slow things down  even less enjoyable  but in the long run I think it s a plus overall    I feel as though you re missing my point  I have no problem with people using challenging words  and I even named a couple of books that do it in a way that makes sense   I was talking about this particular book ;2344
2667;2023-05-29 00:43:00;4.0;I actually made a mistake  Pontonier wasn t in the book  It was ponton   Here s the sentence    The car was a desert colored  rusted out Ford of the 40s  ponton and streamlined       Do you know what that means   Also   logopoeic  propaedeutic  patriotic sentiments were emanating from her      Do you know those ones  If so  I m pretty impressed   EDIT  Apparently the person I m replying to here has blocked me        So that seems to mean that not only can I not reply to that person  I can t seem to reply to anyone in this entire part of the conversation  All these people are saying things to me  but I can t seem to reply to any of them  So weird ;1010
2668;2023-05-29 00:47:00;1.0;Did you happen to read my post  or just a line or two   My issues isn t with the vocabulary  It s with the way that it s put in the mouth of a specific character ;152
2669;2023-05-28 20:52:00;1.0;That makes some sense  I guess  That he s changed a bit over the years ;1661
2670;2023-05-28 21:00:00;2.0;You mean you didn t find my list of words to be obscure  Or that  while reading the book  you didn t notice that the vocabulary was obscure   Because I can totally understand just getting into the book without noticing those words  But if you mean that the list that I mentioned in my post doesn t contain obscure words  and I ve added ponton   used as an adjective  logopoeic  and propaedeutic   then I can t agree   As for what I m used to reading  all I can say is that I read everything ;359

2672;2023-05-28 20:40:00;0.0;  Pontonier  This is a word  It s a worker in the construction of a pontoon     A ponton  in that context  is an old timey car design  https   en wikipedia org wiki Ponton  car    Logopoeic is a use of words in poetry for more than their literal meaning  Propaedeutic means prep studies  Without knowledge of the surrounding paragraph  I can only guess that this means that she was expressing inarticulate  partially informed  maybe meaning that she had a sophomoric level of knowledge    patriotic sentiments     ETA  Well  maybe not  inarticulate   but more like she was using words that sounded good without thinking too much about whether they conveyed her meaning     ETA2  Link about ponton car body added ;1042
2673;2023-05-28 22:22:00;1.0;I would probably glide over  ponton   but just because I have an idea of what 40 s Fords look like  somewhat pontoon like   and the others have cognates that bring something to mind  more or less    We don t always have to know exactly what words mean to get a feel for them  we absorb new words over time  organically   just like children do    I think it works actually  I think that words that I don t quite know  can still sound nice  and still  like  paint a picture  or whatever ;783
2674;2023-05-29 00:01:00;2.0;With that repsonse  it s very hard to believe that you read my whole post  or even my whole comment  Will you read this one all the way   Or my post  Not sure whether you noticed  but I mentioned Nabokov in my post    But he didn t make Lolita  for one example  talk like a university professor  He was aware that different characters have different voices and different levels of vocabulary    When Nabokov  or any good writer  has a character use a certain level of vocabulary  it s not solely because of a love of language  but also because he wants us to understand something about that character    Different characters have different levels of vocabulary    For some reason  you seem to think that I want to read ordinary words only and am complaining about learning new words  I can t understand how you d think that if you re actually reading what I write    That s a complete misunderstanding of my point ;186
2675;2023-05-29 00:41:00;10.0;Sorry  I m not asking you to give me definitions  I m asking whether you know those words off the top of your head  and don t consider them to be obscure   As for ponton  my OED tells me that it s a noun or a verb  The noun  ponton  is just an out of date way to spell pontoon  It s how some people spelled it in the 1800s and earlier  It s not an adjective  but ok  he used it that way   But I don t think it means out of date at all in this context  I think it means it resembles a pontoon   After all  the novel is set in the 50s  so the car wasn t really that out of date  It was past its heyday  but it didn t mean old timey  I understand why you guessed that  though   And the fact that you guessed that answers my question about how obscure it is   EDIT  I know that pontonier is a word  That word wasn t in the book ;2119
2676;2023-05-28 20:39:00;-1.0; We don t always have to know exactly what words mean to get a feel for them  I mean  of course  The person I was replying to is saying that they DO know what all those words mean   EDIT   For those who didn t see their other comment  they literally said    I know what those words mean  so I wouldn t consider them ridiculous ;1266

2679;2023-05-28 22:02:00;1.0;A ponton is a style of car that was fashionable in that era  it is old timey for today  I didn t mean that it was old timey then   https   en wikipedia org wiki Ponton  car     I was guessing because it sounded like the author was being ironic in his description  but I wasn t sure  If that character was a child  then it was age appropriate for her to that  but if it was an adult  then he was mocking     ETA  I didn t want to mislead you if you were trying to parse out the meaning of the passage  that s why I was hedging  Just trying to help you out   I do know these words off the top of my head  but context can change connotation  ;1855
2680;2023-05-28 22:45:00;1.0;well obviously everyone in  r books knows everything   ;828
2681;2023-05-28 22:52:00;1.0; I don t understand why you think his elevated vocabulary seems out of character   And you haven t asked  Your complete misunderstanding of his character nicely highlights why most people wouldn t argue the issue after having read  the first few pages on the kindle sample    You just HAVE to understand how that sounds  Don t you   I could sit here and explain how you ve badly misunderstood his character  I could quote a bunch of lines  or just describe stuff for you  but what s the point   At every turn  you ve either not understood  or read  what I was saying  or have told me that I must be wrong    All about a book that you ve never read     The novel you re complaining about is narrated by history professor  so I would expect an erudite  even ridiculously so  voice  I teach at a university and I have no clue what you re talking about  But the point isn t really what you d expect  but what you actually GET  In all his dealings with people  he s not pompous or showy  He doesn t use language like that at all  Quite the opposite   But you read  the first few pages on the kindle sample   so you know what you need to know   Now you ll probably tell me how I just don t have your understanding of the work  because you read the blurb on the back  So ridiculous ;2298
2682;2023-05-28 23:00:00;2.0;That might explain it  The words didn t seem unusual to me  but I read a lot of police procedurals from that era  and I think you re right  the word choice was very different back then ;1508
2683;2023-05-28 23:04:00;0.0;Oh  it wasn t written in the 50s  It was written in 2021  The narrator is writing today about an event that happened in the 50s ;1351
2684;2023-05-28 23:54:00;1.0;Sounds like it means about what I figured   As for the character  he wasn t a child  or being ironic or mocking  He was an adult just describing the car    if you were trying to parse out the meaning of the passage  Yeah  I wasn t  My post is about how the character doesn t talk like that  or give any indication that he would write like that  but then narrates the story like that   When you said that you know all those words that I listed  I just pointed out that I d added some more and was curious whether you knew all of them  too ;1428
2685;2023-05-29 00:07:00;2.0;The book was published in 2021  and the narrator is looking back from today to an event that happened in the 50s   But you re saying that the list of words I mentioned in my post didn t seem unusual   logopoeic  propaedeutic  cathexes  strappado  carceral  horripilation  pentimento  sudorific  pelage  ponton  capirote  hyemal  lucubration    ;2397
2686;2023-05-29 00:27:00;1.0;I think it can be interesting when a character doesn t talk like  that  and yet narrates like that  I haven t read this one but your description reminds me of something I real a long time ago that was a child s narrative written in adult prose    This might bother me until I can remember it   But anyway I think the assumption can be that the character is pretending to be less sophisticated than they are ;1127
2687;2023-05-29 00:33:00;2.0;most of them are unusual to me  not sure if you were addressing me  if not I may be butting in    I recognise four or five of them  and I  feel  like I should know or be able to figure out what a few others mean      your point that this isn t even everyday advanced vocabulary is pretty hard to argue against   not to swank  but I don t often come across words I don t know   these are up there      I can t speak for if it would irritate me though  as I have not read this book    I know writers who do talk that level of fancy  Anthony Burgess  and I just roll with it because that s how  he  rolls   and I know others where I can hardly follow the text because I m sneering so hard ;1180
2688;2023-05-29 00:53:00;0.0;Hello  it s me  OP  but I wasn t able to reply  I think that since the person above you blocked me  I wasn t able to reply to anything in the thread that he started   In this case  I don t think that s the solution  I just can t think of any reason for him to do that ;267
2689;2023-05-29 01:16:00;1.0;Hello  it s me  OP  but I wasn t able to reply  I think that since the person above you blocked me  which is already amazing   I wasn t able to reply to anything in the thread that he started   ANYWAY  I was talking to them when I said the bit about being unusual  That person has claimed that they know all the words in the list  and that none of them seem unusual        As far as the book  I think I d have noticed it less if it were 3rd person  But what threw me was the idea that the narrator wasn t particularly showy in his language  and even made fun of someone who was ;1328
2690;2023-05-29 01:38:00;51.0;Trigger Warning  SA   This book was SO good  Probably one of the rare times I prefer the sequel to tue first book  Firstly  and big old spoiler warning  Fuck Uncle Marc  All my homes hate Uncle Marc  What a conniving  back stabbing little piece of shit he turned out to be  Maybe it s because I have a young kid but I was so SO angry that he kept her child from her and all for himself because he couldn t admit the people he was with were a bunch of animals  What a self righteous piece if shit   I guess I just wasn t ready to share you with anyone   I hope he suffers  I wish bad and painful things on him  The author absolutely NAILS Zealots as a group of monsters who see themselves as good people akd it makes me furious and scared at tue same time  I truly loved how introducing her daughter as someone READING the journal were given a more objective view of the main character  And I sort of agree with her daughter  Olaminas main goal should ve always been to go after her daughter and Olamina IS a manipulator who uses her super empathy to better get inside people s heads  In an interesting way  the MC doesn t see anything wrong with what s she s doing  And I guess she never uses this power for evil but she is absolutely using it to control and enthrall people  She s dangerous  In an interesting way  I don t think she ever sees anything of her own absolute faith that she s doing the right thing  cause it s for the destiny  reflected back at her by her Christian captors  or even Marc  The ending was bittersweet  but overall hopeful which was nice  Overall 9 10  it s worth it to read the first one just to get to the second one   Quick edit to say that I also loved how she never used the word Teacher for her captors  always  Teacher  with quotes  Like she never gives them the satisfaction of the title ;777
2691;2023-05-29 04:16:00;8.0;Octavia Butler is just    haunting  No matter how realistic or far out the book is  she makes the reader care about it    I also preferred Talents to its prequel    ;396

2693;2023-05-28 22:27:00;3.0;I haven t read these books in years but your comment takes me back instantly  These books were so powerful  I remembered reading it during the US 2016 presidential election cycle and was just sad reading the platform and seeing how people justify taking children    then we saw it with separations      Another commenter used the word  haunting  and that is a perfect encapsulation of these two books  I wasn t able to touch another book for at least a year after these two ;434
2694;2023-05-28 22:32:00;2.0;I just got to the halfway point of Sower myself  The BIG change that s been hinted about finally happened and I ve been debating about whether I should continue to the sequel  I vaguely skimmed the plot on Wiki and was still unsure but your post does help that I would make the right decision in continuing after Sower  Hopefully if Sower caps off good I ll give the sequel a go and feel the same way you do ;1635
2695;2023-05-28 22:50:00;1.0;Omg I read Parable of the Sower last month  should I read Talents   Sower was so bleak  is Talents is worse I dunno if I m up for it;444
2696;2023-05-28 23:21:00;1.0;I m still sad that Butler passed away before she had written the third book   this was supposed to be a trilogy  Excellent novels ;1231
2697;2023-05-28 23:45:00;1.0;finding this thread a few days late but i just finished talents  god octavia butler knows how to scare the shit out of me but at the same time give me hope  i was upset at the ending  not for how it played out  but how asha never seemed to fully grasp how hard her mother looked for her  yes  earthseed was her first  child  but her continuing to travel and spread the word only really happened because she was searching for larkin asha  i couldn t believe the bombshell that marcus had kept olamina s daughter from her  obviously he lies to asha about her mother s death  but i figured she was dead by the time asha found her way to marcus anyway  was blown away to read she lived to be 81  i don t blame olamina for not forgiving marc  but maybe if she did she could ve had more of a relationship with asha  i also don t blame asha for being hesitant to become close to her mother  either way i am happy to have found this thread to get my thoughts out to others cuz no one i know has read it   trying to convince everyone  thank you octavia butler and rest in power ;1749
2698;2023-05-28 23:53:00;1.0;She s a pretty neat writer  I wasn t totally sold after the first book but after Talents I m def going to read more of her  I REALLY liked this line    They would teach us what it meens to love their Country and Fear their God    CHILLS;1123
2699;2023-05-29 00:01:00;1.0; haunting  is the word   I couldn t finish Sower because it hit home so hard that I was getting depressed ;2037
2700;2023-05-29 00:08:00;1.0;I think its 100  worth it personally  the second is the better imo ;1398
2701;2023-05-29 00:28:00;2.0;I would argue that Talents for a majority of the book is bleaker  If Sower was an 8  Talents is probably a 9  It s more of the same from the first book  the shitty people  the SA  the doom and gloom  etc  with an extra layer of something I don t want to spoil  It s a rough read for sure  but well worth it imo  You ll definetly feel something ;84

2703;2023-05-29 00:43:00;2.0;I totally understand the frustration  but for me I lean more towards Asha  Earthseed can wait  If she had just been using Earthseed to gather resources to go after Larkin with the full financial backing of a church then I d be a little more on the Olamina side  And yeah dude I haaaaate uncle Mark  I can t begin to imagine keeping someone s child from them after they told you over and over again how much they wanted to find her  Also his self righteousness at  she was with a good Christian family   Like his intentional ignorance and compliance with the church makes me furious  I just want to shake him lmao;1612
2704;2023-05-29 00:47:00;2.0;Hope so  I m honestly not too impressed so far  This  hyper sensitivity  hasn t served the story much at all  if any  and really comes off as hyper  it matters only if I see it  gabadygook  Especially soldiering on after that massive thing and  sensitivity  doesn t somehow affect her  Bottled up or just   Eh  I expected this   Something  ANYTHING to come out later  Was it a way to dump off a load of characters  Won t know to I get more into the book   The world around and how people are dealing with it is what keeps my interest so far  It s like the struggling Middle Class has to fall to Corporate Slavery or get swallowed into Lower Class Cartel Style Violence thus cutting off lower bounds of the Middle  The personal results of these politics at play showed at the half point of Sower  As long as that political plot line improves the story  I m may be down for the sequel ;318
2705;2023-05-29 00:52:00;1.0;Yes   Born in Pasadena in 1947  Butler died in 2006 without finishing the third book in her  Parable  series     https   www latimes com entertainment arts books story 2020 10 09 octavia butler reading guide parable of the sower;2348
2706;2023-05-29 00:54:00;3.0;Yeah the super empathy is weird because at first I thought it was some sort of psychic thing  But it s nothing so fantastic  To my understanding  your body forces you to feel whatever you perceive the other person to be feeling  it s like a compulsion  It DOES matter more in the second half of the second book for whatever that s worth lol   Politics and morality play a larger role in the second book imo so it might be worth it ;2098
2707;2023-05-29 00:54:00;1.0;See thays turbo weird because it was my understanding that both books were originally one  and it ended up just getting split into two like Hyperion;1612
2708;2023-05-29 01:13:00;427.0;I  34F  personally read Dracula once a year and have done now since I was 17  My friend  who isn t someone who enjoys reading  noticed I was reading Dracula once again and was absolutely baffled at the idea of re reading books  She understood the idea of it being my favourite book but couldnt see the point after 2nd maybe 3rd time as you know the story fully  I tried to explain that its more  that just my favourite story but that I almost use it as a measuring stick for personal growth year to year   I find this book to be so layered and complex that each year I come away having noticed something I hadn t before  or taken a different interpretation of certain symbolism  In the early years it was ever things as simple as learning new vocabulary     So my question to you what book do you re read and why ;37

2714;2023-05-29 05:52:00;65.0;I read the dictionary  specifically the definition of biannually  about once a year because I can t remember whether it means twice a year or once every two years ;1742
2715;2023-05-29 07:14:00;13.0;I reread Terry Pratchett books constantly because they are jam packed with tropes  puns  and other fun literary and movie references  You just can t get them all at the same time ;1959

2719;2023-05-29 15:43:00;32.0;I could give the simplest answer  because I enjoy them  That s not enough ;254
2720;2023-05-29 18:58:00;5.0;Titus Groan  and less often Gormenghast as well  because I love the world and the characters and Peake s prose   It s like a vacation with old friends   Gene Wolfe s Book of the New Sun because I still discover new things each time   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy because it still makes me laugh ;894
2721;2023-05-29 19:09:00;7.0;Nostalgia  Returning to books I read when I was younger and the world seemed simpler  Discovering new details I had overlooked during previous readings  Knowing what to expect and that I won t be disappointed by the journey or ending  I don t reread them every year though  just every few years ;431
2722;2023-05-29 19:14:00;5.0;Every year on my birthday I eat a frozen Charleston Chew and read If On a Winter s NightA Traveler   I read it for the first time in Highschool and everything just felt so new and fun and unexpected  It s a nice trip back  and  like you said  a pleasant introspection reflection on the previous year ;1920
2723;2023-05-29 19:45:00;7.0;Lord of the Rings  Because its fantastic;670
2724;2023-05-29 20:44:00;6.0;My dad started reading me the Lord of the Rings as a baby  He read it to me every night until I was a teenager  I still read Tolkien a couple of times a year  It reminds me of that bonding time now that I m an adult  My dad was a single dad and just kept me with him all the time  He didn t find children s stories overly interesting  so he read what he liked  I also got Beowulf  the Anglo Saxon chronicle and the real Grimm tales    I do read Dune twice a year and am rereading Game of Thrones with my best friend  It s amazing seeing things differently every time I have a read through ;1965
2725;2023-05-29 22:39:00;15.0;I usually reread East of Eden at least once a year or any Steinbeck book  Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors  his words are just amazing and still relevant   I feel like his works is enjoyable even in this modern age;600
2726;2023-05-29 22:50:00;6.0;I have always done this   someone has written about it i just can t remember who   its often a comfort thing   as someone above said  like going to see old friends;941
2727;2023-05-29 22:52:00;6.0;its like watching a movie  When I re read the book  it makes the brain pictures go again   Do some people not get the brain pictures when they read ;2171
2728;2023-05-29 23:54:00;5.0;There are a million reasons to reread a book    In fact  the only reason NOT to reread a book is because you don t want to ;2162
2729;2023-05-30 01:01:00;12.0;I reread Blood Meridian by Cormac M once a year because it is a work of art and I m stupid morbid I guess ;1922
2730;2023-05-30 01:06:00;12.0;I very rarely reread books  in part because I remember them well many years later  and in part because books I enjoyed initially have ended up feeling less magical upon rereads  Never Let Me Go and Hardboiled Wonderland were some of those    That said  Nomad Love by Youssouf Elalamy is a novella I reread every year for it s tight prose and beautiful themes of culture and identity    Others I ve reread a couple of times are Mat Johnson s PYM  Danielewski s House of Leaves  Marlon James  Dark Star Trilogy  Salvador Plascencia s People of Paper  and Shane Jones  Lightboxes ;619
2731;2023-05-28 21:27:00;12.0;I do this with quite a few books  Same reasons as you  I do the same with music and movies too  There s onions everywhere ;1264
2732;2023-05-29 01:11:00;6.0;I read let it snow   I ve been since my 11th grade every Christmas  It saw me through some really tumultuous times and every year   I read it  it s like added nostalgia for the years to come by too  I know it by heart but It still makes me happy happy;2118
2733;2023-05-29 01:49:00;4.0;That s me with Frankenstein  I reread it every year  I also love Frankenstein for personal reasons and it s comforting to me  But I also take more away from it with every read and year  And I love learning about Mary Shelley as well  which gives it even more context for me  And I have a bad memory so there s also that ;2267
2734;2023-05-29 02:09:00;5.0;The list of books I haven t reread would be shorter  I love rereading books ;1409
2735;2023-05-29 02:28:00;4.0;I reread Harry Potter every so often for nostalgia of my childhood and relationship with my bio dad  I read both Percy Jackson series every once in a while because I still like the concept of Greek Mythology told by kids  and I love 13 Reasons Why as it was something that got me through a very difficult time in my life  I have both my original damaged copy and the anniversary edition with the alternate ending and they re both 10 10 to me   Rereading is especially easy for me now that I have a Kindle and library card for ebooks  I do have all the previously listed books  and most of their counterparts  in physical copy for my bookshelf but I love to be able to pull out my phone or Kindle and read anywhere   ETA  I m 25 and experienced all of these 10  years ago  I was read Harry Potter in the womb  so to me it is a reminder of my childhood  I also can t remember all major plot points to things more than a month or so after reading so I like to pick them up again and experience those things I forgot almost as if it was the first time again ;23
2736;2023-05-29 07:03:00;3.0;I can t  I try but it s so hard for me to reread books or rewatch shows movies  There are a few books I ve read multiple times but there s so many new things I want to consume ;127
2737;2023-05-28 20:58:00;3.0;My wife doesn t see the point in rereading books  I ll reread for comfort or amusement  or because something reminded me of it for no reason and I thought I d check back     I quite often reread London s Fields by Martin Amis  and since he died quite recently I ll probably read it again along with some more of his books  Douglas Adam s first Dirk Gently novel and the Annotated Alice as well    All books that I ve turned to often again and again   Probably not a coincidence that they all have a very dry dark sense of humour   I think with all 3 there are a lot of subtle jokes or turns of phrases that you can miss or forget about from previous readings  There s also things that I just look forward to reading again but it only works in the context of having read the whole book  The plots of London Fields and Dirk Gently are so dense but so easy to read you can easily want to read it again to pick up on the nuances ;199
2738;2023-05-28 22:11:00;3.0;Even if you know the story  there are details that you forget ;1592
2739;2023-05-28 22:11:00;3.0;There are very few books I ve read multiple times so I wouldn t say I read the same book bi annually but it s usually because of something special in it   I ve read the first 3 books of The Dark Elf Trilogy  the start of Drizzt s adventure  because honestly I love Menzoberranzan and Drizzt s story growing up for it was a nice read   It has to have something special for me to want to re read it   In this case it s a city that is basically the definition of a very evil city where every house is in a somewhat less than cold war with a gentlelady s agreement to keep it from a full out war with a political undertone and vying for power   Where every action is judged in whether it will help their house move up   Rereading it is less about the main character and more about the setting ;1340
2740;2023-05-28 22:30:00;3.0;most of my family rereads the scorpio races by maggie stiefvater every november  if you ve read it you can probably guess why we do it in november  for me  i love the atmosphere of the book  stormy and cold and rainy and so so alive  we also bake november cakes  its just a book we all love and a year is a long time  enough time to forget a fair amount of details and it feels like rediscovering an awesome book again;900
2741;2023-05-28 22:42:00;3.0;It s like visiting an old friend ;255
2742;2023-05-28 23:58:00;3.0;I read the first Drizzt book and the first Dragonlance book usually once a year  Those two books are what made the the bookworm I am now;1005
2743;2023-05-29 00:41:00;3.0;Just ask why they watch movies shows more than once  or play a video game again  or listen to a song again and again;1193
2744;2023-05-29 01:03:00;3.0;Misery by Stephen King  The essential dykes to watch out for By Allison Bechdel  And Dracula too for me  I enjoy beauty of stories  My brother teases me that I revisit stuff  But there s something about coming back to characters that s comforting and rewarding ;113
2745;2023-05-29 01:14:00;3.0;I ve been a huge fan of re reading books when its active series and a new edition is coming out  For me that was Wheel of time  the dark tower  Dan Simmons work  It help reveal foreshadowing and expand on themes  Writing this makes me think I should re read Lord of the Rings after reading several other Tolkien novels  It took me 20 years to be mature enough to read LOTR  much less discern Personalities in the Book of Job  Also  the Anime Akira took a lot of time to understand  My favorite authors are beyond me in some aspect  It takes time and maturing to be able understand some concepts  so rereads are in order ;1214
2746;2023-05-29 01:14:00;3.0;I read  2 books a week and have never understood my bookish friends who go back and re read books and series repeatedly  I d love to hear perspectives on why others enjoy this ;1590
2747;2023-05-29 01:23:00;3.0;I re read all the books in a mystery series right before the new one comes out each spring  It gets me more excited for the latest book ;985
2748;2023-05-29 01:33:00;3.0;I reread books that I LOVE  Harry Potter I reread yearly  It s a comfort series that I know brings me joy  I also reread it during fall each year so it also kinda gets me into the new season  After that    I reread books I want to re experience  I m planning on ReReading Percy Jackson this year  Possibly Six Of Crows even though I read it this year  Long story short  I reread books that I know I love and I want to experience the characters  world  etc  again ;600
2749;2023-05-29 01:34:00;3.0;I reread A Christmas Carol every year at  obviously  Christmas mainly out of tradition and I just love the redemption story    Usually sometime after the new year I reread Tribe by Sebastian Junger because it s a great reminder of how connected we actually are meant to be and that in true times of trouble societies have actually banded together to help each other  and hopefully that will can stay that way if when something terrible happens ;1885
2750;2023-05-29 01:39:00;3.0; removed ;328
2751;2023-05-29 01:40:00;3.0;I ve reread Their Eyes We re Watching God once or twice every year for the last 7 years  It s so beautiful and every time I read it  I always find something a little new  Despite its beauty and fantastic writing  I think the real reason I continue to reread it is because I ve never read anything like it before  It s POV to vernacular  everything is just so unique  Truly a precious book  11 10 recommended read   ;2419
2752;2023-05-29 01:50:00;3.0;For me it s a comfort blanket   I like knowing mostly what s going on  but there s always something new I find   Or maybe there s something that resonates differently because my life is in a different place each time I read my favourite books   If I m going through a stressful time or my concentration is affected  books I know really well are easy   Often they ll knock me out of a reading slump;1332
2753;2023-05-29 01:53:00;2.0;Those books ate populated by friends I care about   I like going to visit those friends every now and then ;274
2754;2023-05-29 01:57:00;2.0;Because every TIME I reread the wheel of time I discover something new;2081
2755;2023-05-29 02:04:00;2.0;There s lots of books I ve read more than once  and a few that I know I ll continue to return to  because of their messages and the way they make me feel  I want to experience the story again ;383
2756;2023-05-29 02:20:00;2.0;I read Water for Elephants every other year  It s my favorite book and I love the story   I also read 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership every year  It grounds me and helps me reevaluate my current situation ;409
2757;2023-05-29 02:21:00;2.0;I listen to books over constantly  my most listened being Cloud Atlas  ASoIaF and The expanse  each book more than 10 times each  I listened to stuff at work but once I ran out of new podcasts for the day  I d do those for the rest of the day  It s easy to miss stuff when you re listening  so for stuff that s dense I find new stuff or make new connections all the time;1917
2758;2023-05-29 02:22:00;2.0;Like eating comfort food ;2378
2759;2023-05-29 02:30:00;2.0; was absolutely baffled at the idea of re reading books  I m just about positive that your friend listens to the same song more than once because she likes it   ;354
2760;2023-05-29 02:34:00;2.0;It s going to depend on my mood  Sometimes I just want a familiar friend with nothing unpredictable in it  but lines that still raise a smile no matter how many rereads  Usually when I m in a medical waiting room  That s when I grab Good Omens    I reread a lot of nonfiction because my memory is terrible and if I enjoy the author s style it s as entertaining as fiction in its way  Carl Zimmer  Bettany Hughes  Mary Beard and Nick Lane are reliable authors   I tend to look at books like I look at music   I have never listened to music only once  What I get out of it each time might be different  or it might be comforting and familiar  But it almost always rewards a repeat visit ;578
2761;2023-05-29 02:36:00;2.0;Because the temperature can hit 110 degrees or higher in June  July  and August for weeks  I like to reread The Long Winter by Wilder  It helps me feel cooler ;2239
2762;2023-05-29 02:41:00;2.0;It is no different than watching a movie or TV series more than once  Or listening to a song more than once ;563
2763;2023-05-29 02:42:00;2.0;I read A Night in the Lonesome October by Roger Zelazny every October  It puts me in the mood for fall and it s just an awesome story ;295
2764;2023-05-29 02:53:00;2.0;The characters or settings in the books I reread are friends to me  They make me feel comfortable and welcome  the way my human friends do  So when I feel in need of certain companionship  I go back to those books ;2079
2765;2023-05-29 02:55:00;2.0;How is it any different from listening to a song you already know the words to  Or viewing a painting you ve already seen ;259
2766;2023-05-29 03:00:00;2.0;I like visiting old friends   ;2029
2767;2023-05-29 03:00:00;2.0;Have they ever rewatched a movie ;1524
2768;2023-05-29 03:04:00;2.0;I read Northanger Abbey every summer because a  it is SO entertaining  and b  I notice new things every year  ;1801
2769;2023-05-29 03:05:00;2.0;I read Allen Ginsberg s Howl and Other Poems  1956  at the end of every June to celebrate Pride in my own  literary way  I m a bit too stuffy for parades  but I am gay  so this is my way of observing  I ve been doing so every June since graduating college  so this year  2023  will be my 12th reading ;937
2770;2023-05-29 03:13:00;2.0;I reread the hunger games if I get in a certain funk  same for Harry Potter  I love rereading books I love  especially if I ve gotten older or if my life has changed  When I first read the Hunger Games my focus was all on Katniss and how could she get through the games twice and the revolution  As I got older I began to understand more the idea of being an unwilling pawn in a game  The last couple times I read it  I became more and more disgusted with Gale but I can not absolutely not understand or tolerate Katniss  mother  Now that I am a mother myself I cannot begin to imagine allowing my children to almost starve because I am too lost in my grief  nor allowing my only living child to go back to our home without me because I couldn t  handle it  ;827
2771;2023-05-29 03:20:00;2.0;Some books are like being wrapped up in a warm blanket with a cup of cocoa in your hands  next to a warm fire  while a cold winter storm rages outside  Some books are like going home  whatever  or whoever  home is to you  Some rip the ground open right beneath your feet  Some lift you up  Some encourage you to do more  be better than you currently are  Some are different every time you read them  Some do more than one of those things  or something else entirely   It is a beautiful thing to reread a book  and I hope your friend discovers that beauty for herself ;1077
2772;2023-05-29 03:31:00;2.0;People rewatch movies  re listen songs  re visit same places for holidays  eat same foods again and again and so on   So why not re read books ;2371
2773;2023-05-29 03:38:00;2.0;I have a handful of what I call my  comfort books   I reread them because going back to them is extremely comforting to me  It s like having happy places  only they re books ;1822
2774;2023-05-29 03:38:00;2.0;I have comfort books I like to re read because they take me back to the first time I read them  Also  I can usually spot new details or little things i d forgotten  so there s always some points of interest;2438
2775;2023-05-29 03:39:00;2.0;I reread Fahrenheit 451 every year  This is because I m a teacher who s curriculum requires it  Lol But this is definitely the book I m most excited to teach each year and my students can tell  It was one of my favorites I read during high school and I would love for nothing more than for them to find a book they also love and reread over the years    For my own enjoyment  I read Anne of Green Gables every few years  I can still remember the lady at church who introduced me to that series when I was 12  I m currently rereading Project Hail Mary  It has been a few years since I read it and I convinced my book club to read it this month  I forgot how good it is  The storytelling is so compelling  I feel like I m reading it for the first time  Finally  and I know this book gets hate on this sub and I don t care because I love it  I reread Ready Player One probably about every 18 months  Clearly my life revolves around a feeling of nostalgia and this book is full of it  I ll never apologize for rereading this book many times and loving it ;844
2776;2023-05-29 03:48:00;2.0;Although the book doesn t change  you do  Each reread brings something different  whether it be a new perspective or new vocabulary ;1403
2777;2023-05-29 03:51:00;2.0;I read The Hobbit every year as soon as fall starts  My mom first read it for me when i was 6 and when i was 12 i bought my own copy  I still own that copy and read it annually for nostalgia and to celebrate that fall  my favourite season  is here;2114
2778;2023-05-29 04:02:00;2.0;I just enjoy re visiting something that I already know I will enjoy ;428
2779;2023-05-29 04:04:00;2.0;For me it s the same reason as I play certain video games periodically or certain films  Atmosphere      They have a certain unique atmosphere that I want to dig into and experience every now and then      So it s why I read Lord of the Rings every year or so  or Alice in Wonderland  They re unqiue atmospheres I don t get anywhere else  Likewise why I ll play Shadowman every year or so too  or Half Life 2 ;910
2780;2023-05-29 04:04:00;2.0;Sometimes we do not just love reading for the story or the fact that you should read something new  I love rereading my favourite series because of the familiarity of it  the characters feel like my friends  and everytime you reread a book or series  you discover something new about the story ;303
2781;2023-05-29 04:11:00;2.0;I love reading my favorite books over again  sometimes you notice a little detail you somehow glossed over or forgot from your last reading  I do the same thing with my favorite book Carmilla  It s short but it s always stuck with me  Some may not consider it a  book   but I also reread Watchmen every year as well  It s my favorite graphic novel  and it s a great piece of literature   Edit  also I d like to add  you re rarely the same person you were the last time you read your favorite book  It s nice to find new ways you relate to it or how it connects with you differently than it used to ;80
2782;2023-05-29 04:13:00;2.0;Some  like Harry Potter or Hitchhiker s Guide  are comfortable friends in stressful times    Others  The Good Terrorist or Huckleberry Finn  let me better understand how I and the world have changed since the last time I read them     Nonfiction  like Made to Stick or The Generals  reinforce things I want to make part of my daily life ;110
2783;2023-05-29 04:13:00;2.0;I like to read  The Stand  in early April  just as people start sneezing from allergies ;297
2784;2023-05-29 04:14:00;2.0;I ve reread  wuthering heights  every year since I was a teenager  No matter what has changed in my life it always gives me a feeling of coming home  Of course nothing is ever as good as the first time but the emotional satisfaction I experience when I read it never dies ;1878
2785;2023-05-29 04:25:00;2.0;It s interesting that nobody would question somebody ordering their favourite meal in a restaurant again  or returning to the same vacation spot  Rereading is the same principle   you simply want to experience something enjoyable again  Revisiting characters you love or gorgeous writing is a real treat ;1012
2786;2023-05-29 04:36:00;2.0;Just ask your friend why he listens to the same song every year;167
2787;2023-05-29 04:36:00;2.0;I used to do it when I had more time  I felt like I noticed something new or got something different out of the book each time I read it  Maybe it just means I need to read more carefully on the first read through though  Lol;436
2788;2023-05-29 04:39:00;2.0;Have you heard of Dracula Daily or RE  Dracula  Because I think there are a lot of people who understand rereading Dracula every year ;179
2789;2023-05-29 04:43:00;2.0;I have a couple I read every year  And yes  I catch new things every time ;166
2790;2023-05-29 04:47:00;2.0;I actually have certain books that mark the seasons changing for me  One about summer one about winter  It just seems to symbolize a new beginning and gives me joy is comforting;803
2791;2023-05-29 04:53:00;3.0;I read Harry Potter series 13 times   don t ask me why it s not even good imo ;42
2792;2023-05-29 04:56:00;1.0;For a few years  I would read the same book almost daily  It was a kids dinosaur book and what my kid demanded for bedtime reading ;1785
2793;2023-05-29 04:57:00;1.0;Why are you listening to that song again ;753
2794;2023-05-29 04:59:00;1.0;Why does she eat her favorite food or listen to her favorite song more than twice ;760
2795;2023-05-29 05:11:00;1.0;Dracula is required reading every October for me ;675
2796;2023-05-29 05:16:00;1.0;Great Gatsby   It s literary whiskey for me ;376
2797;2023-05-29 05:20:00;1.0;Some stories are good and hit all the right spots and its just fun going along for the ride with the characters again  Every couple of years I read the Ender s Game and Shadow series in completion  maybe not again after the latest book  and I watch breaking bad once every year and a half or so  They are just satisfying stories that have enough diverse details that I ve forgotten enough for each experience to be captivating all over again ;1215
2798;2023-05-29 05:25:00;1.0;I read the same few series in a sequence over and over again  I read new stuff too  but I always have back up stuff to read that I know I love ;357
2799;2023-05-29 05:32:00;1.0;There are a few books I ve read a hundred times  Most rereads are anywhere from twice to thirty times  Some literally have enough nuance to always discover new things  But I don t reread for the newness  I reread because I do already know what s going on and it s like running into an old friend I haven t seen and it being like no time has passed  I m the kind of reader who looks up the plot and all spoilers before I read  too ;11
2800;2023-05-29 05:54:00;1.0;I mean  there are people rewatch shows almost constantly   like they just always are watching The Office    I re read The Pelican Brief and Ender s Game every year for a long time  I think I found both of those books and read them during a very significant summer in my life  and reading them again helps me deal with transitions and stuff  Idk ;1455
2801;2023-05-29 06:03:00;1.0;I read Winter Solstice by Rosamund Pilcher almost every year because it is so freaking cozy  I am a northerner who has lived in the south for a very long time  and I have a very hard time every winter because I feel displaced and homesick  Reading about the cozy houses  cold weather  short winter days  and people finding love and hope is just what I need at that time of year ;1530
2802;2023-05-29 06:05:00;1.0;Same reason I rewatch movies  Some times suprises are great  but sometimes I need the comfort of my characters behaving predictably ;362
2803;2023-05-29 06:10:00;1.0;As a child  I read Where the Red Fern Grows at least 10 times  Why  I am a glutton for punishment  I suppose  but I loved that book  As an adult  I ve read The Stand at least 10 times  It was fun in the beginning as I got deeper into King s works to see the spiderweb between his books  Now I m in my forties and I haven t re read a book in quite a while but your post has inspired me to visit some old favorites  I might try reading The Master and Margarita again  I read it at 19 and I bet it s way different now at 44 ;937
2804;2023-05-29 06:28:00;1.0;To remind or proofreading something  to feel again  to feel different  to feel new feelings  just bc i like and  why don t  Hehe so many reasons;1820
2805;2023-05-29 06:31:00;1.0;I read A Wrinkle In Time every August  It s the reminder I need to bolster my compassion before the shit show that is first year college students who are hormones and chaos  They re all little Megs and it reminds me of their potential ;2421
2806;2023-05-29 06:31:00;1.0;I give Peter Watts  Blindsight a reread once every year or 2  At first it was due to the construction of his characters being complex and difficult for me to grasp on first read  Then due to the depth of the philosophies he was unfolding and defining I felt a regular rereading was the only way to shine and light on and honor his message  I felt  still feel  enlightened on each read  it s like discovering a new gem in the same old mine shaft  A reread can be so enriching  it s hard to convince someone of that value unless they ve experienced it themselves;112
2807;2023-05-29 06:36:00;1.0;I read    A Christmas Carol    every year  and I try to finish it on Christmas Eve  I m a fan of Dickens  and the book gets me in the true spirit of Christmas  Valuable lessons can be learned from this book  even if you don t celebrate the holiday  The lessons have become more and more potent as I ve aged  I realize mistakes I made in the past  and I hope to improve for the future ;2076
2808;2023-05-29 07:09:00;1.0;I m with you  Too many books  Too few years living  There are many things I would reread  but none I have as an adult  Well  Catch 22  Keller is so funny  Yosarian such a great character ;1213
2809;2023-05-29 07:09:00;1.0;As others have said  some books contain old friends  for me it s anne of green gables and for several years I would reread harry potter every year or so  Some books I reread and they re different because I ve changed and my life has changed  Classics hold up to rereads because they are timeless  they tell you different things at different stages in your life  As a child  I read the little house series and loved it for the adventure of it all  As a wife  mother  I read it and got frustrated with pa  and felt sympathetic for the crazy  woman on the prarie school who obviously had ppd  and cried for Laura and Manly in their first four years  The first time I read pride and prejudice I loved the romance and the speech  the last time I read it I cried laughing at the sarcasm I missed as a teen  I love coming back to a good book  there s always something new to take away from the greats ;703
2810;2023-05-29 07:19:00;1.0;i reread most of my books every 3 6 months and the answer is simple   i have a terrible memory;616
2811;2023-05-29 08:00:00;1.0;Cosmos and Demon Haunted World  Because ironically both works are like a gospel to me   grounding  illuminating  dreaming  and optimistic ;1962

2813;2023-05-29 08:27:00;1.0;Because I always notice something new or different   Also  because there are times I am more comfortable in Narnia or Oz than my hometown ;1194
2814;2023-05-29 08:32:00;1.0;I m a pastor and for four years after my aunt died  I would read CS Lewis  A Grief Observed during the month of January  because that s when my aunt s cancer became terminal  It made me feel like I wasn t alone in my grief and that someone lauded by Christians across tradition  was validating my own wrestling with God  I needed that reminder until I could remember it long enough to sustain me ;1542
2815;2023-05-29 08:38:00;1.0;I re read Gone With The Wind every year around Thanksgiving  and the Harry Potter series during the month of December  They re some of my fave books so I like to read them during the  comfy  months ;37
2816;2023-05-29 08:56:00;1.0;Hopefully not yearly  but I reread the Harry Potter series at every new place I move to  No place feels like home until I ve experienced the story there   I also just read Howl s Moving Castle very regularly  like at least once a year but more like whenever the urge arises  but that s my favorite book and a comfort read and I just regularly feel the need to chortle at Sophie and Howl  as one does ;226
2817;2023-05-29 08:57:00;1.0;For me  some books are comforting to read again  Night Train to Lisbon  Anil s Ghost  A Thousand Acres  and I notice and learn new things when I reread others  Bleak House  Moby Dick   I only reread books that I really love  though ;877
2818;2023-05-29 09:26:00;1.0;I read a childhood favorite once every 2 years or so  It was my absolute favorite book as a kid and I love going back into that world   ;2413
2819;2023-05-29 10:14:00;1.0;I reread a lot of books as a child  mostly because I enjoyed the world so much that the author built  Hogwarts is obviously one of those places I wanted to revisit an innumerable amount times  There was a point in my life where I could cite dialogues and even know down to ten pages where in the books certain information was written   Nowadays I am having adult responsibilities that take up a lot of my life  so during my little and precious free time  instead of rereading books I will try to work on my to be read stack ;367
2820;2023-05-29 10:21:00;1.0;I reread a lot of the W40k books I have  Me and my deceased brother loved talking about them and it makes me feel closer to him ;759
2821;2023-05-29 10:22:00;1.0;It feels like a warm hug from an old friend ;2268

2823;2023-05-29 10:50:00;1.0;For me there are several that I reread and each one has a different reason  Mostly it is because I love the book or series and I do audible so it doesn t take much time to reread them  There is one that I absolutely love and reread it because I sometimes miss the world that book is in  Then there is another book that I reread whenever I need cheering up because it is cute and funny and I love all the little jokes  There are so many reasons to revisit an old favorite ;151
2824;2023-05-29 10:57:00;1.0;I was never one to go back a re read a book  I have too many on my to do list  but I have gone back a listened to the audiobook of books I have read a realized I don t remember the books as well as I thought I did   Even when I went back a listened to audiobooks I first heard a few years ago  I didn t remember everything correctly   This has made me realize that re reading some of my favorites might been a good idea because I know I don t remember all the story ;1619
2825;2023-05-29 11:01:00;1.0;I read Neuromancer once a year or so  it reminds me of the time when I was forming who I am now  discovering politics and punk and dystopia and music  all of that comes back ;1927
2826;2023-05-29 11:01:00;1.0;I re read Dandelion Wine by Ray Bradbury every summer  Well over 20 times  I read it because Greentown IL circa 1928 seen through the eyes of young Douglas Spaulding is my most favorite place on Earth  Absolutely every chapter in this book is magical  I get so excited when it s the first day of Summer and I pick it up to start reading it again ;1474
2827;2023-05-29 11:26:00;1.0;I don t personally have a book that I reread   BUT i watch sex and the city every year when I don t have the bandwidth for something new  The REAL joy that i get out of it is realizing I have a different perspective on the situations every year  Kind of a fun measuring stick for growth ;55
2828;2023-05-29 11:30:00;1.0;O Brien s Aubrey and Maturin series  Twenty volumes  so not exactly an annual thing ;2171
2829;2023-05-29 11:32:00;1.0;Many books get so much better with the reread  My circumstances and knowledge change everything about the book when it s good  I am constantly learning and reading more and more  and sometimes when I go back I catch more references to other literature or historical events ;1443
2830;2023-05-29 11:35:00;1.0;Used to read the hobbit and LOTR yearly until the movies came out   Also the Count of Monte Cristo  I have a paperback copy that is almost unreadable ;1913
2831;2023-05-29 11:43:00;1.0;Cormac Mccarthy s Blood Meridian for me  I love it  I ve never read anything like it and every year it bewilders me  Its bleak and it s violent  Its a masterpiece ;604
2832;2023-05-29 11:53:00;1.0;I read LotR and Count of Monte Cristo every autumn for a decade because they gave me immense pleasure each and every time  If it makes me feel good  I do it  That s the entire explanation ;157
2833;2023-05-29 12:02:00;1.0;I re read the Harry Potter series almost year since it was a big part of my childhood and makes me feel nostalgic  also interesting reading it from a more grown up perspective ;923
2834;2023-05-29 12:32:00;1.0;I ve read the Dune series every 5 years since I was 15  Each phase of my life brings a new perspective and understanding of the generations of characters  There is plenty of story  philosophy  and character to mine ;257
2835;2023-05-29 12:45:00;1.0;The Handmaid s Tale    I first read it in high school over 25 years ago  My grandmother had read it and told me how terrifying it was    I ve studied it and analyzed it  I have M ni re s disease  and when I have an attack and need to focus on something other than the dizziness  I listen to it on audiobook because the words are a comfort and I can fall asleep and not worry about missing part of the story    It s a security blanket and a touchstone  I am familiar with all of the emotions the book evokes  and welcome them in myself  I know where I am going when I am with this book ;1477
2836;2023-05-29 13:03:00;1.0;The Hobbit  It is one of the few stories that can take me out of myself and place me somewhere else  It also gives me a sense of peace and hope;194
2837;2023-05-29 13:12:00;1.0;I listen to books while I fall asleep and go through the same cycle of about 10 or so different series that have become comfort books;2410
2838;2023-05-29 13:21:00;1.0;I like to give  World War Z  a reread every once in a while ;2346
2839;2023-05-29 13:40:00;1.0;The Princess Bride is my US coast to coast flight book  Can t tell you how many times I ve read it now ;402
2840;2023-05-29 13:42:00;1.0;My memory sucks so I use it to my advantage  Every time I re read a book I m like the guy from Memento ;1693
2841;2023-05-29 14:04:00;1.0;I read Normal People by Sally Rooney once a year   Centering around an on and off relationship over the course of four years  I have seen myself in it in a different way every time I ve read it  I ve seen mirror images of my former relationship   both the good and the bad parts   depending on when I was reading it   The first time I read it I was in said relationship and thought  oh that s us because despite everything they find always each other and they know each other in such a special way   but the last time I read it  after my relationship ended  it was  oh that s us because neither of them ever say what they actually feel and that was their demise   One day when I get into another relationship I ll probably interpret it in a whole new way   Just the quintessential relationship book for me  It ll stay with me forever ;1544
2842;2023-05-29 14:20:00;1.0;Because each read is different  Each time I read I am different  Each time I read  I am looking for something different  And each time I read  I pick up different things ;2159
2843;2023-05-29 15:08:00;1.0;I read The Great Gatsby frequently and have since I was young  Dune is probably the newest one that I enjoy rereading though  Things just hit different over time ;872
2844;2023-05-29 15:13:00;1.0;I ve read my favourite books many times  The greatest books are confusing on first read  and get more and more explicable as you read them over and over ;1585
2845;2023-05-29 15:20:00;1.0;I think I want to start doing this now  I just need to find the right book ;115
2846;2023-05-29 15:47:00;1.0;I still feel the same excitement reading it like I did the first time  there are details I ve forgotten about or not picked up before  I find it comforting ;682
2847;2023-05-29 16:05:00;1.0;I read A Christmas Carol every year at Christmas time   Then Jane Austen all her novels   Harry Potter  Bram Stoker s Dracula  Montalbano every couples of year   It s like meeting an old friend  you know him  but there is something new to say every time  Books are the same  but we change  evolve  mature  so we can actually find something different every time we read them   Is like that for me  at least ;441
2848;2023-05-29 16:45:00;1.0;I reread LoTR about once a year  And Philip Pullmans His Dark Mayerials every few years  They are such good series it s hard not to reread them  While great movies the LoTR movies aren t as good as the books imo  I have yet to watch the BBC series for HDM  though I have heard really good things  the movie had perfect casting but was a travesty ;954
2849;2023-05-29 17:07:00;1.0;Why does someone rewatch their favourite movie or revisit their favourite place  or replay a game they ve beaten    It s to revisit the joy they experienced while also gaining new experience  insight  and self reflection   I re read Pride and Prejudice on the regular  I find that sometimes  depending on what s going on in my life  different quotes or moments hit differently than they did before  or I get a joke I missed  or I understand a character in a deeper  more complex way  because I have grown and changed and experienced things in the time in between  And it s a familiar  comforting experience and sometimes when things are hard that s really nice to have ;2094
2850;2023-05-29 17:34:00;1.0;wheel of time series  everytime a new book came out  it really changed what you KNEW and made what seemed like throwaway or casual lines in earlier books suddenly mean something important  Robert jordan was an absolute master of leaving cookie crumbs that eventually paid off;42
2851;2023-05-29 17:50:00;1.0;I m in my 50s  and I ve reread Moby Dick each decade of my life  having first read it as a teenager   It s pretty fascinating how different each read has been  I really think our cognitive and language skills continue to develop  particularly the ability to recognize patterns and structures ;524
2852;2023-05-29 17:51:00;1.0;I went through a decade of rereading the Harry Potter series every summer  It started as me reading out loud to my younger brother and then when he got too old I read them on my own because each year my brother got older I would put it in perspective of his age  Like  when my brother was 12 and Harry was 12 it made it even crazier to imagine a kid going through all of that  I m 10 years older than my brother  so it was just a really wild lens to read the story through;132
2853;2023-05-29 18:03:00;1.0;I don t have the same ideas  thoughts  interests  or even beliefs that I had when reading my favorite books again  It s a wildly different experience reading Dune and Lord of the Rings at 31 than it was when I first read them at 10  Or even when I read them two years ago ;2097
2854;2023-05-29 20:03:00;1.0;I read the Harry Potter series once a year  I m reading because I enjoy the material  not because I don t know the story;92
2855;2023-05-29 20:15:00;1.0;Same reason I rewatch all my favorite movies and shows  I love being a part of the world  enjoy the characters  etc ;2215
2856;2023-05-29 20:24:00;1.0;I d be more surprised to hear that heavy readers  don t  do this ;2301
2857;2023-05-29 20:36:00;1.0;I read the Wheel of Time series every couple years   Because it s my favorite   I forget enough stuff that it is always fresh and I can skim through the parts I don t care that much about ;67
2858;2023-05-29 21:48:00;1.0;Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen   As someone who struggled with reading as a child I found it a huge task to get through the book due to the style of language used  Now it is a comfort book that I tend to read more than once a year as I always feel a sense of accomplishment each time I finish it ;1707
2859;2023-05-29 22:53:00;1.0;Reading the same book every year is extreme  I reread the same books every few years    I give more time for me to change  or learn better English      Other case is when I read again Proust   I do it because of how it is written   it s like talk with an old friend  even you know nothing new happened in his life ;1847
2860;2023-05-30 00:14:00;1.0;I ve read read many of my faves along the years  Sometimes as soon as I ve finished them  Because the world they create in my mind is hard to abandon cold turkey     And you also discover details you hadn t noticed on first read   Ignore your non reader friend  If she doesn t like to read she won t understand re reading    If she insists compare it to te watching favorite movies or series  Or ignore her  ;387
2861;2023-05-30 08:03:00;1.0;I used to read Jane Eyre once a year  Been meaning to get back to that tradition  I m not exactly sure why except it s like rewatching a movie you really like ;404
2862;2023-05-30 13:46:00;1.0;I always compare reading a book to non readers as watching a show  I can read multiple at once just like you can watch multiple tv shows at once  And just like how you rewatch your favorite shows you can reread and enjoy a book you enjoy ;1510
2863;2023-05-30 22:19:00;1.0;Sometimes after reading a new book that was awful  you want a reminder of something good ;568
2864;2023-05-31 10:55:00;1.0;I reread Harry Potter from time to time because it feels like home  Same goes for Hobbit  I reread Christmas Carol every other Christmas but that s more of a ritual ;1840
2865;2023-05-31 20:27:00;1.0;To misquote Pink Floyd    The book is the same in a relative way  but you re older    Reflecting your own growing experience in what you read and getting different things out of it ;1144

2868;2023-05-29 06:56:00;1.0;I reread the Old Kingdom Trilogy a couple times a year every year since I was in middle school  I m 32 now  for reference   I couldn t tell you why I reread them over and over  I love the characters and the setting and their magic system seems very grounded   Maybe it s because Tim Curry narrated the audiobooks   I ve started doing the same thing with this Christian fiction series called the Chiveis Trilogy  It gave a a Similar feeling of groundedness in the setting  so perhaps that s the attraction  To me  the worlds of these respective series feels so real and lived in ;148
2869;2023-05-28 20:46:00;1.0;Ooo  Oh wow  this is serendipitous  I  personally  can t think of too many books I ve gone back to and none that I ve read year to year but I  was  going to say that every year  Dracula Daily  https   draculadaily substack com about  e mails out the full story of Dracula as it happens  on the days that it happens  And then I read your post and found out your yearly reader was Dracula  That s so nutty   Oh well  If you hadn t heard of it already that might be a way to enjoy it again next year  It started on May 3rd  but you can read the archive if you want the full experience ;750

2877;2023-05-29 01:01:00;1.0;Into the wilderness by Sara Donati  Absolutely adore that book and I re read it once a year along with the rest of the series because I love the feelings it gives me  My partner recons he gets excited when I pull it out because I get extra lovey dovey towards him until the last page is turned in the last book  Lol;787

2881;2023-05-29 10:33:00;1.0;I don t have a book I read annually but have you heard of Dracula Daily  Thousands of people are currently reading Dracula together  for I think the 3rd or 4th year   This year there s a podcast production  too which is honestly amazing called Re Dracula  It follows the daily entries chronologically so it ends when the novel does in November ;1301
2882;2023-05-29 06:36:00;1.0;I love that you love Dracula so much  OP  Such a good book   From the age of 12 to somewhere in my early 30s  I re read the Agatha Christie novels  in publishing order  continuously  I loved the glamour of the era  I picture the clothing and hair in my head meticulously   and I loved putting myself into the mind of either the detective or Hastings and remembering what it was like to be befuddled by this or that clue  I also enjoy imagining myself into the murderer in early scenes  thinking   I ll fool them by saying  this     I have also re read  on a loop  the Cat Who novels by Lilian Jackson Braun since age 12  Again  I love revisiting the atmosphere of the novels  and much like you with Dracula  it is an absolute joy to see the protagonist and other characters in a new light each time  I was a 12 year old kid when I met the main character  who was a middle aged man  Now I m almost his age  I understand SO much more of everything  and it s comforting  Something that has existed in my life in the exact same form changes as I change  It s beautiful   I also reread King s IT every decade or so for similar reasons  the joy of the atmosphere and the story   Let s not even talk about the TV shows and movies I ve rewatched a million times  It s like revisiting old friends ;2362

2884;2023-05-29 08:57:00;1.0;Love the leviathan series from Scott westerfield  Read it all the time and the scenario and art is so amazing;586
2885;2023-05-29 02:12:00;1.0;I see no point ever reading a book twice  just like I only play most games once ;544
2886;2023-05-29 06:40:00;1.0;Books hit different at different stages of your life  Plus  it s a comfort thing   I reread discworld books    a lot  It feels like catching up with old friends ;1519
2887;2023-05-29 08:14:00;1.0;Ive read the Culture novels by Ian M banks  and the Malazan series by Erikson many many times   For me  its because they are enjoyable and dense and perfect to re read  You can basically get something new out of the experience each time   As for the culture novels specifically  I even enjoy listening to them on audiobooks as my bedtime story  I really love them and dont think i will ever stop reading them ;612
2888;2023-05-29 01:03:00;1.0;Your life  your outlook  your experiences are constantly changing as you grow older  Many times that beings new insight or meaning into a book  The dangers of religious despotism portrayed in Dune were something I understood well enough when I was younger  but spending 30 years watching people try to play that out really puts an edge and desperation to some of that book it didn t have when I was a teenager  Dark Tower is a yearly cycle for me just because I enjoy the story so much ;380
2889;2023-05-28 20:37:00;1.0;The Great Gatsby  Less Than Zero    92 In The Shade  I re read these at least once a year  Every time you pick up something different or something thst can even relate to now;2155
2890;2023-05-29 04:49:00;1.0;Sometimes it s just    comforting  I read some of Terry Pratchett s work every year  Not all of it  but some books every year  Or I listen to them every year  It helps keep the memory of that world alive  now that the author is no more  Those books have shaped my thinking and my personality a lot more than I realized when I first started reading them  I ve become calmer  perhaps kinder and certainly a lot more accepting of things that I personally might dislike   I don t find a lot of new stuff in the books anymore  but I do find old friends and old voices that I miss hearing ;2176
2891;2023-05-29 09:55:00;1.0;I re read the Anne of Green Gables series every year and have since I was a kid all 8 books    She s a good friend at this point and I like to visit her  Also  I have gotten a lot of different things out of the books over the years  When I was an awkward  lonely  smart teen  the early books really spoke to me  Anne and I also been poor college students living with best friends  in a long distance relationship with a partner  newly married  young moms  and experienced moms  I am really connecting with the last couple books lately  they focus on her children and their friendships as they get older like my kids ;1653
2892;2023-05-29 08:03:00;1.0;I read Siddhartha every year  and come away with something new from it every time;1604
2893;2023-05-29 08:55:00;1.0;Honestly after rereading House of Night series by PC Cast and Kristin Cast every year for a about a decade it was only last year that I realised that the authors had put in so much double meaning in to a piece of prophetic poetry  Every year when I reread the series I find something new in it ;2179
2894;2023-05-29 01:48:00;1.0;I read my favourite trilogy at least once every winter  Sometimes I feel like reading it more than once a year  I haven t skipped a year since I first read it  in 2015   and every time I find something new to bookmark  a scene to add a post it to  a new word to cry over   Those books have more post it than pages lol  They re twice the size they should be   I have drawn on most blank spaces  wrote on every side space  highlighted and underlined every important moment  and every moment that s important to me   It s like opening an old box full of memories and nostalgic feelings  painful but safe  Sometimes it s safer than it s painful  other times it s the most suffered read of the year   Sometimes I open it to find comfort  because I miss my old friends  my old family  Other times I open it to twist the knife in a wound  to add insult to my own injury   I just can t let it go ;2417
2895;2023-05-29 17:13:00;1.0;not to be weird but this is why i will forever re read paradise lost  I  too  use this as a reference for personal growth and am always amazed at what new angle interpretation i come away with    for a little context i ve taken three seminars on it now  but it was my favorite  book  after my first class back in 2017    for a more chill read  I like re reading Frankenstein  it s a text that can be analyzed from almost every literary lens theory  and i love that she was 18 when she wrote it ;79
2896;2023-05-29 20:44:00;1.0;I don t really re read books  Because I don t have time  sure  but also I sometimes don t want to change ruin the experience I had reading the book the first time  Because every time you revisit a book  you see things from a new perspective s;852
2897;2023-05-29 10:04:00;1.0;I ve re read The Sun Also rises at a few different  eras  of my life  my teens in highschool  my  wandering 20 s  after college  and just recently after having my first kid and purchasing a house in the burbs   Every time  my feelings about the various characters have been drastically different  For example  when I first read it  they seemed so  grown up   worldly and sophisticated  On my last read  they seem childish  lost  and immature ;162
2898;2023-05-29 05:46:00;1.0;My annual re read is The Hogfather by Terry Pratchett  I love the story  I love the characters  I love how it wraps up in the end in a satisfying way  It also has the added bonus of being a holiday book  so having a preset timeframe to re read it each year is nice   The funny thing is that while I ve read this book the last five  years  I haven t read much else of his work   I am working on it  though ;1401
2899;2023-05-29 06:48:00;1.0;Lots of reasons  coming down to I just love them and love experiencing them  I reread books I can t stop thinking about until I can stop thinking about them  American Gods  and Cold Earth by Sarah Moss both get yearlyish rereads because I just can t get them out of my head  I can t count how many times I ve reread Harry potter and my other formative books from my adolescence  Rereading them is pure escapism   Then there s a whole other group of books that I reread because of the way they make me feel  Aristotle and Dante discover the secrets of the universe makes me weep every time  and I read it 5 times last year  Salt and skin by Eliza Henry Jones resonates so deeply with me  Stephen kings It makes my stomach churn  Shakespeare plays  specifically Macbeth and the Tempest  often make me pause and savour the lines  All these books give me butterflies in one way or another  and I want to keep feeling that ;2332
2900;2023-05-28 21:20:00;1.0;For the last three years mine has been Jurassic Park  When I was in school I used to have an exam ritual of taking The Story of the Trapp Family Singers to read after exams   Not for the same reasons as OP  but just because I like it and sometimes I need to unwind with some dinosaurs causing havoc ;1321
2901;2023-05-29 01:09:00;1.0;Terry Pratchett s Discworld series  While being a fun read  I seem to manage to figure yet another pun that has escaped me for the last three times I read that particular novel  And besides  I just like visiting with old friends ;2140
2902;2023-05-29 10:06:00;1.0;I reread Life of Pi every so often  maybe every other year  It s nostalgic since i ve been reading it since I was a teenager ;1833
2903;2023-05-28 20:57:00;1.0;Someone else on this thread said  No man can step into the same river twice  for it is not the same river and he is not the same man    Close  but no stogie   I will agree that the experience of reading a book once  or repeatedly  changes you   I say you can t read the same poem twice  for while the ink and paper are the same  you are different   As long as it changes you for the better  let the new you read what the old you already read ;1950
2904;2023-05-29 06:54:00;1.0;It s like listening to an album of your favorite music;540
2905;2023-05-29 01:57:00;1.0;Ive reread A Good Girls Guide to Murder  entire trilogy  many times just because it s  in my opinion  such a well written and enjoyable read  It has you on your toes  and has so many twists and turns I couldn t ever get sick of it  I really like rereading books because like you mentioned  you always find something new  but with mysteries you realize how blatantly obvious the ending is WAY before you realized the ending during the first read  I just find it similar to movies  sure I know the entire plot of Ratatouille  but it doesn t mean I don t want to see the tiny rat cook again  I dunno maybe it s because I m still young  but I really enjoy reading things many times  and keep it up  ;2255
2906;2023-05-29 02:03:00;1.0;I reread  Mountains Beyond Mountains  by Tracy Kidder about the doctor Paul Farmer every year  It grounds me and reminds me of the power and importance of empathy  compassion  and recognizing each and every person s humanity  The difference it makes to genuinely care and take action  The ability one person has to change hundreds of lives through dogged and unconventional tactics  To quote the late Paul Farmer   I m not cynical at all  Cynicism is a dead end   Reading this beautifully written book reminds me of that  and always rejuvenates me to keep trying to make a difference ;2325
2907;2023-05-29 01:09:00;1.0;Because so many books are about the characters and the feeling you build with them  the point is more to re visit those emotions  which is why the plot can be familiar  but the book can be so satisfying on a reread ;14
2908;2023-05-29 03:38:00;1.0;is it any good   P;2318
2909;2023-05-30 18:04:00;1.0;I reread LOTR every few years  I am always surprised at things I missed or don t remember every time  Tolkien added so much depth to his world there is always some new connection or little detail I find each read   And on top of that I usually read some other work  The Silmarillion or Unfinished tales for in universe history  Or things like The Letters  or essays like On Fairy Stories  then reread with a new perspective  looking for new themes etc     The last time I read it I really slowed down and spent time looking up and words that caught attention  Either words from his invented languages or archaic words  It is amazing the linguistic effort he put into it  even when things are in  common speech  certain groups will only use words with Germnanic roots or Anglo Saxon roots   there s really enough to spend a lifetime studying    And of course its just a great story ;423
2910;2023-05-29 16:10:00;1.0;I never re read  Maybe it s my ADHD but I have an issue with focus  I lose it easily;1718
2911;2023-05-29 07:35:00;1.0;LOTR every few years  Strider   Sam  Also most of Discworld when comfort is needed  Have recently discovered Murderbot helps me think about AI  Familiar books at bedtime rather than something which won t let me sleep ;1914
2912;2023-05-29 14:08:00;1.0;I reread the first Percy Jackson book every summer  sometimes the whole series  I really loved those books as a kid  and now as an adult they just give me such a warm feeling of summer and nostalgia ;1743
2913;2023-05-29 07:59:00;1.0;There are some books that I either can t get enough of or hear something new each time or both    Legacy by James Kerr  The Power of Moments  and Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman to name a few life changers I could put on repeat forever ;930
2914;2023-05-29 10:26:00;1.0;I do a yearly reread of all my favorite series  Some only get a reread every 2 years  others I ve reread 3 5 times in the same year  It s just so comfortable  I know what happens  I know certain people won t die and others that do ;1473
2915;2023-05-29 01:07:00;1.0;The most random Nora Roberts books  It s mostly a  I need to read but I don t want to read anything new because I don t want new information and this is just autopilot  sorta thing;2120
2916;2023-05-29 06:53:00;1.0;Re reading gives me the feel of the world again  especially if there s good world building   Reading  and u can say writing too  feels like a door to a room with no real end except your imagination  You can imagine the world differently every reread  and then you notice symbiosims and minor details     Or maybe I m reading  pun intended  too deep into this ;667
2917;2023-05-29 10:54:00;1.0;The best books show you something new or bring you a new realization every time you read them  Those are the books I tend to go back to again and again ;1675

2920;2023-05-29 06:16:00;1.0;I reread a book called alongside  a religious book about being a friends to teens in need  because it s a eye opener that I was in that position and no one knew how to help me so through learning and reading the book I can help someone hopefully;2101
2921;2023-05-29 17:04:00;1.0;Just ask her how many times she s seen her favorite movie ;472
2922;2023-05-29 09:39:00;1.0;I ve read Clockwork Orange 4 times  but admittedly on the 4th time I thought Why am I reading this again   I read LotR in 2019 and am planning to read them again next year  six months apart  so a year long holiday   but really for the atmosphere and a visit somewhere else  Your friend should be pointed out that ppl jam the same movie over and over for the same reason ;2266
2923;2023-05-29 09:37:00;1.0;I don t reread new books  but I am not a stranger to reviewing series  As a writer  i instantly notice how beneficial it is for me to rewatch my favorite series  I do it out of habit  and I can say I come away enlightened after having watched it again   Every small bit of text I read or watch in movie and book form helps me as a writer ;813
2924;2023-05-29 14:18:00;1.0;I reread books for a sense of comfort  especially my favorite ones  Rereading them regularly  like once a year  makes the growth in my perception feel natural  otherwise coming back years later can take that comfort away because what I take away has changed so drastically that it feels like a new book ;1641
2925;2023-05-29 02:40:00;1.0;ACOTAR and FBAA  Also dark Olympus  They ve all become my comfort series;2357
2926;2023-05-29 08:33:00;1.0;I reread A Christmas Carol every December since it a  helps me get in the holiday mood and b  reminds me of a very important part of the season   which is helping others   For the past 5 years I ve reread The Shining in the fall because its spooky and also because I keep getting new things out of it   I think  even if you don t read something every single year  its always great to revisit books periodically so you can see how you have changed and your perception of them has changed ;2060
2927;2023-05-29 09:50:00;0.0;This might be true to every big reader  but personally there is a specific dream story i see as my ideal  My favorite books have only ever touched parts of my ideal but never the full  The books that are closest i read over to get back that specific feeling when things go right exactly how you wanted it to  The edibles are starting to kick in so i might type too long and this makes less and less sense as i go on I m about to take another one right now  It s all subjective because remember it s a specific feeling  In your mind as you read you are thinking of how you d like the story to end  For me  it s really difficult to enumerate in words and in an altered mental state  One book  like Eragon touches a bit of it  A world with magic that s more extensive than simple bibbidty boppity boo stuff  But still it touched it a little too    I also read a necromancy book where there are powers in the modern world  But necromancy is not seen as strong and most die because you need to be close to death to use it and they have short lifespans  But turns out it s stronger than usual  Typical underdog turns op story  But it scratches a part of the ideal   I love reading the light novels  Release that Witch   And reincarnated with an ai chip or something  The former because the romance is great and the women are treated like people  But it s a male centered well done romance  I like romance and I m a guy  But most of the more well done romance is made with women protags  Of course the former was made by a woman so that s probably why it s great  but it scratches that itch  Also  there s the underdog shtick plus he ll never be op because he can t use magic  He s a normal guy  But he s using the power of the witches  He s a brain  so are some of the witches  Anna is my dream partner  so he s physically normal in a world of beholders demons as genetically enhanced brain dead paladins and powerful witches  It s so good  But my complaint is that we don t see him grappling nearly with the consequences of him directing death as much as I d like  He saved the whiches so they are blindly loyal  He s always correct  It s a shame because when it s tested  they seem mindless  Doesn t fulfill ideal  I ve read this many dozens of times   There s one about a guy with a gambling addiction  has been disowned by most of not all of his family  But he manages to get into a fantasy ish world as a merc for hire  He becomes a hero in that world but still needs to face the consequences and reconcile with his family  Seeing him overcome a foe and be looked at as a trusted leader but still fumbling his words when apologizing to his little sister for abandoning her to gamble is so emotionally riveting  But they introduce characters from another series who harms one of my favorite characters for no reason and treats her like shit  And they are supposed to be good guys and no apology  Author just treats it normally  Misses the ideal    This light novel called  The Death Mage that Doesn t Want a Third Time   Man  Again i say its all subjective  Some may disagree  But this light novel is the closest to filling most of my ideal  You have the perspective of a person that deserves revenge  wants it  but prefers to let it go  The characters he deserves revenge on are good people  They are all different and well fleshed out and their increasingly varied reasons for stopping the mc are reasonable when you consider   Our mc is insane  The death mage has been driven crazy both by his past existences and his unique affinity to death  Thing is his warped view of life is normal if you look at it from his perspective  He has undead  zombie friends  These zombies cannibalize  He s keeping his mother from death to bring her back to life  an affront to  some  gods  The sort of creatures around him have warped his sense of normal  So if his zombies eat you  what s wrong  You eat other animals and don t heed their cries  All souls are equal  Speaking on that  the big reason why he s dangerous  he can interact with and break souls  See  the universe has reincarnation  Souls were meant to be things that couldn t be created or destroyed  But a demon lord with the ability to break souls attacked and nearly destroyed the gods  Now our mc comes later with it   If a baby had the ability to destroy the world with a thought at 6 years old  what sort of moral dilemma would you have in deciding to kill it or let it live  How about if this baby s perspective and way of seeing life is significantly different than yours  And what if your kind caused significant harm to them  You have the chance to stop it now given all that  Do you   Now what if the baby tells you it won t destroy anything  Would you trust them  Should you force others to  Would you understand if others didn t  And would you agree with the baby to treat you as an enemy if you didn t stop the others from hurting it given that  That s our dilemma  Trust and morality  Or survival    Lastly there s a relatively new one i read  A light novel that has a reincarnated kid  And one who actually tells his parents  And they actually react normally  The mom freaks at the idea of the boy sucking her breast when he was really a 40 year old stranger  The dad wondering if the mc killed the soul of his real kid and is wearing the body like a suit  And the mc  the target of this questioning  rightly becoming distressed  He grew to see them as his parents  That s just a small thing i liked  They reconcile later  The big thing is the deep storytelling and setup of politics and shit  and then war destroying all that from people from a continent with a completely different society and magic system  The really long war  the dehumanizing of this new side we ve just met with the mc after learning all the intricacies of OUR L  the mc and reader s  culture  The first part immerses you so deep into the world building  when the invasion of an unknown society happens  you are on the mcs side as though you re a countryman  You dehumanize with him  grieve with him  You hate the OTHERS with him  Then the story changes  Now it s the perspective of other side  The mc is forced there  He has to go undercover and find a way back  We hate the girl he meets who helps him out  Both we and the mc look at her with disgust when she speaks of her military brother with worry  And we both begin to humanize her after we see how much more like us she is  We are having this change in opinion right  Slowly starting to humanize  and as the symbol of the war  he can change things  However the story still shows us stuff is going on on our original country  The mc was taken by those animals  The reader is now shocked at the words now knowing how human the others truly are  Their hate grows since the war is still continuing  While you and the mc s hate disappears  your family  people and loved ones deepens  Now the reader gets to see words they had previously normalized and accepted  in a light after that otherization and it s embarrassing  It s not done so i gotta wait for more chapters  What will happen when mc comes back    So I ve forgotten the point of this comment but yea i look for the ideal peace;1512
2928;2023-05-29 03:29:00;0.0;It s no different than rewatching a show or movie for me  Also I m a fast reader by nature and have never been able to force myself to slow down  which means I notice or renotice tiny details each time  I have comfort books I return to over and over  the Lord of the Rings  Watership Down  Sunshine  by Robin McKinley   honestly too many to name   What really confuses me is why people ever buy books if they don t plan to read them more than once  I almost never buy a book unless I ve read it before  generally multiple times  and plan to read it again ;1935
2929;2023-05-29 05:56:00;164.0;Thank you  you have given me the quote I needed to explain this;2292
2930;2023-05-29 09:53:00;-18.0;Except it IS the same river      Books are an author s thoughts  frozen in time  replicated and reproduced year over year   They are wholly different from a river which is ever changing and evolving   The only way your metaphor would work is if the subject was an oral story  not a written one  then the teller would change as the river does ;1177
2931;2023-05-29 01:54:00;-57.0;I disagree with the metaphor  geographically it is the exact same river  and biologically   dang it  I can t comprehend that kind of logic  I want to believe the essence soul spirit DNA of said man is the exact same as well   Thus  his memory of the river will be very similar  and he may well see physical changes around  yet it is the same location  the same source of water  the same river  the same man   We can insert our feelings  embellish our memories and arrive at a result that needs to much work to get to in the first place   Looking at the world simplistically when needed can save a lot of work   So  the same book  same paragraphs  same characters  same pages   I m not opposed to re reading at all  more people should be reading even if it takes re reading  I simply cannot do it myself and I have attempted many times over many years ;1141
2932;2023-05-29 09:52:00;25.0;I have a profound experience reading Austen at different ages  I get something different when I read about Lizzie Bennet or Anne Elliot when I m younger  their age or older than them ;1747
2933;2023-05-29 20:15:00;9.0;Those last three books make me think you would really enjoy  Gentlemen of the Road  by Michael Chabon  He wanted to write a story just like those classic adventure novels  and it s excellent ;800
2934;2023-05-29 15:19:00;6.0;I think this is the real reason   It s the same reason why people play the same video games  watch the same movies  go to the same places  listen to the same music   and also the reason why  4 chord songs  exist  etc  Humans are wired to like things that we recognize  Our body gives us a dopamine hit every time we reuse the same pathways in our brain   We want to escape our lives  so we read things we recognize    If you ve ever been depressed  you understand this intently  New things  new places  new characters  new stories that you don t know the outcome to are     hard  Reading watching listening to the same things is     easy ;224
2935;2023-05-29 15:21:00;2.0;exactly this ;833
2936;2023-05-29 07:04:00;49.0;This  When I was younger I use to reread the entire HP series in the summer    Mostly to build hype for the next release in the series    It was always great to revisit Hogwarts ;2161

2942;2023-05-29 12:00:00;5.0;Maybe because it takes such time commitment to complete a book  I am an avid reader but it took time and almost discipline to get to this point where I enjoy it so much  but before I  got it   I too would probably be flabbergasted by the commitment or enjoyment from it  But now I totally get it   ;542
2943;2023-05-29 10:50:00;1.0;is it weird  op is the first I m hearing of anyone being shocked about rereading books;1804

2945;2023-05-29 14:40:00;15.0;It can be either  Which is awful ;8

2947;2023-05-29 17:57:00;1.0;I ve written the whole dictionary long hand  Suspension punishment  I got suspended a lot ;1417
2948;2023-05-29 19:11:00;1.0;I tried reading it but I just couldn t like that book even though I really liked other works by him  My friend always thinks I m so weird for this;921
2949;2023-05-29 17:25:00;12.0;Tbh this is the only answer that really matters;223
2950;2023-05-31 02:10:00;3.0;I ve lost count of the times I ve read the Book of the New Sun and I agree that always find something new  I really enjoy Gormenghast as well  In case you haven t encountered his work  I d strongly recommend Michael Cisco   The Narrator would be a good start ;463
2951;2023-05-29 14:47:00;2.0; My definition of good literature is that which can be read by an educated reader  and reread with increased pleasure     Gene Wolfe;414
2952;2023-05-29 17:58:00;3.0;Oof  that s like my insomnia brain deciding that I should rewatch Schindler s List once a year;1420

2954;2023-05-29 18:18:00;4.0;Yeah I don t really reread anything except for books that are in a series  I will usually reread a series back to back to pick up on stuff I missed  Or reread it before the next one in the series comes out ;1244
2955;2023-05-28 19:57:00;1.0;I read A Christmas Carol every year too ;1088
2956;2023-05-28 20:51:00;1.0;Spoiler Alert    You ruined it for me ;650
2957;2023-05-29 02:15:00;1.0;I mean  assuming we re talking about listening to a single song as opposed to an entire opera  the time commitment is a pretty big difference ;1066
2958;2023-05-28 23:23:00;1.0;Exactly ;51
2959;2023-05-29 05:58:00;1.0;So the funny thing us I always start it on 1st April  I have no idea why I just do  Obviously trying to keep spooky season energy throughout the year;2307
2960;2023-05-29 04:15:00;2.0;Hey Fellow Enders Game Shadow fan here  I did this as well  Looking forward to revisit the series once the Hive Queen  prequel book of the 1st invasion  comes out ;258

2962;2023-05-29 15:36:00;2.0;I m logging this comment on my goodreads ;89
2963;2023-05-28 19:35:00;69.0;It s from Heraclitus     Especially with a book like Frankenstein which is nothing like the movie versions  Rereading allows you to see it and yourself differently   There are others reasons  each book and person probably has their own built in reasons but this one should be pretty understandable even if it s not something they themselves want to engage in;1980
2964;2023-05-28 23:06:00;20.0;No man ever steps in the same river twice  for he is not the same man        It still works fine ;2100
2965;2023-05-28 20:48:00;13.0; geographically it is the exact same river  location identity    i want to believe the essence soul spirit DNA of said man is the exact same as well   according to Buddhism there is no essence  no soul  the self is a label we apply to an ever changing continuum to falsely imply continuity over time;1791
2966;2023-05-28 21:14:00;8.0;  geographically it is the exact same river  I m a geographer and this is only kind of true true in a  very  broad and simplistic sense  Mostly  it looks the exact same on the map because the broad strokes are probably close enough and mapping rivers is painful  and impossible if you want a 100  accurate measurement  see the coastline paradox  because of their insane variability  they are the opposite of static  If you do any kind of river boating  measure the miles between mileposts on your map  there s a very low chance they re accurate  In fact  they probably weren t ever entirely accurate  But nobody s going to remap it unless there s a major channel change because someone else could do it at the same time and get something different and then a week later there s a major flood with significant bank erosion and suddenly their new map is out of date already   The metaphor is pretty apt as far as rivers go  I can t speak with authority on people  but I know I m a very different person now than I was 15 years ago and I respond very differently to the same plot beats and characterizations of books I read back in the day ;2044
2967;2023-05-29 12:01:00;13.0;The book is the same but you are different  with a different perspective  more experience  you ve been exposed to more ideas and themes so might pick up on something you didn t notice or think about before   You might appreciate a character more knowing they will go through a change  or be able to see things the author set up before a reveal later in the book  They might want to relive the experience of reading the book  even if they know where it ends up  just getting to be with the characters again can be comforting   Have you ever willingly listened to the same song more than once  It s pretty much the same thing;1721
2968;2023-05-29 19:09:00;2.0;The river is composed of different water than it previously was  and the man has physically and mentally changed as well  your point really doesn t make sense    EVEN if it takes re reading  I read dozens of books a year  and I quite frequently reread things  It doesn t  take  rereading  it s not a negative thing I had to do to fully comprehend the book  I just enjoy revisiting them  Yes  often I ll have more context to understand the content and language  but most of the time I just enjoy reading the book   Any book worth reading once is worth reading twice  Any world worth immersing yourself into is worth revisiting   What kind of books are you reading that have left you with the impression that the only reason to reread is  as you re insinuating with your phrasing  not properly comprehending the book ;810
2969;2023-05-28 23:30:00;2.0;Reading pride and prejudice at 14 was an experience  to say the least  Re reading it at 25 was a whole new experience lol;1410
2970;2023-05-28 23:32:00;3.0;On m my list ;2310
2971;2023-05-28 23:31:00;12.0;I still reread Harry Potter once a year  I don t know how I find the time to do so  But whenever an event that makes me anxious comes up you will find a HP book in my bag ;2442
2972;2023-05-29 12:06:00;3.0;Have you listened to Harry Potter and the sacred text  It s a podcast on rereading secular books  especially fiction  as a way to learn how to be better people  It was a really engaging way to think about books I d read so often ;1680
2973;2023-05-29 19:12:00;2.0;Does it say a lot about me that when I saw  HP  I expected Lovecraft and not Harry Potter   ;1961
2974;2023-05-29 19:12:00;1.0;I m blanking on where this is from again Please help ;1902
2975;2023-05-29 12:10:00;12.0;Yes  I re read HP  Not every year  but every 2 3 years  Also the Narnia books  Both remind me of how much I loved those stories when I was much younger ;1576
2976;2023-05-29 19:18:00;17.0;It takes less time to read a book than to rewatch a tv show  though ;721
2977;2023-05-29 20:47:00;1.0;to be clear  I ve seen people shocked about specific books people read regularly  but repeat reading in general  nope;455
2978;2023-05-28 20:44:00;10.0;That s a much better way to be forthright about your plans to schedule a meeting every fortnight ;932
2979;2023-05-28 17:37:00;5.0;Flammable and inflammable;1746
2980;2023-05-28 18:49:00;5.0;It should be every two years  Semi annual would be twice a year  But people misuse biannual  so now you never know which it is ;42
2981;2023-05-28 18:11:00;1.0;Cisco s new to me and looks interesting   thanks ;1691
2982;2023-05-28 23:15:00;2.0;Yeah I know right  D;601
2983;2023-05-28 23:38:00;2.0;I love the audio book too   autonomous  gives me chills everytime;589
2984;2023-05-29 07:41:00;3.0;Nitpick  and I apologise for it  but it s actually not an accurate rendition of Heraclitus  It is rather what Socrates quotes Heraclitus as saying in Plato s Cratylus   What we have from his fragments is more accurately rendered as  upon those stepping into rivers staying the same other and other waters flow   In other words  the reason some things stay the same is due to the constant change that underlies and enables their abiding constancy   phusis   ;1599
2985;2023-05-29 04:45:00;-16.0; Dracula;41
2986;2023-05-29 07:36:00;-11.0;No it doesn t  The point of that quote is each step a man takes is a different river  this is only possible because the river itself is in a constant state of change  Something that the blogger who co opted that classical quote apparently doesn t understand  nor do the 600  people who up voted it     x200B   There s a little bit of a difference between one step followed by another within a span of seconds  and what  reading a book once a year     x200B   If someone reads the same book back to back to back every day for a month are people claiming that those experiences are going to be markedly different     x200B   People don t read the same book because they want a new experience  They read it because they want something familiar    It s not a river  it s a blanket ;2262
2987;2023-05-28 21:51:00;2.0;Yeah I don t know what I was thinking ;6
2988;2023-05-28 22:07:00;1.0;Replacing all of my reddit comments to say this website now sucks  and I m out  Maybe Steve Huffman should just grow up ;2127
2989;2023-05-28 19:21:00;1.0;You are a different person with each and every experience you go through   If I tell you a joke and you laugh  and the very next minute I tell you the same joke   yes  you are still  u lemmesenseyou but you have now gained the experience of the joke from the minute prior   so you have changed at least in that small way from before   In a way  we are very much like the river you are trying to measure   In many ways the same  same location  same beginning  same end  same flow  same name perhaps   But everything that interacts with us is like a grain of sand carried by the water s flow   And in time  with enough  can change the course dramatically ;281
2990;2023-05-28 22:41:00;1.0;Probably right ;1044
2991;2023-05-28 20:40:00;8.0;all the copies of the book change when no one s looking;1916
2992;2023-05-28 22:49:00;0.0;I don t know  I got nothing for you  Boo all you d like ;749
2993;2023-05-29 12:55:00;3.0; Me too   There s something so comforting about revisiting the castle and characters    In fact  I m moving in about a week and a half and my books are all packed up   I actually feel like I need to unpack and get at minimum Sorcerers Stone out ;1949
2994;2023-05-29 00:51:00;2.0;I also enjoy this podcast  Sometimes the two creators can be a little overly preachy or their ideals are not that aligned with mine  but overall I d say it s a solid 8 out of 10 podcast  Really enjoyable and the angles with which they come at some of the scenes in the books really do bring a fresh perspective ;2112
2995;2023-05-29 01:01:00;6.0;Yes  you are so cool and not like other girls ;2406
2996;2023-05-28 21:31:00;7.0;Depends haha;137
2997;2023-05-29 01:56:00;2.0;I think the thing about that is that for a TV show you could just pick your favourite or a couple of your favourite episodes   It would be pretty weird if I randomly busted open LOTR  hand picked three unrelated chapters that I particularly enjoyed  read them and then just stuck it back on the shelf again  If you re rereading a book you enjoy either read the whole thing or don t bother at all imo;90
2998;2023-05-28 18:43:00;2.0;More effort is a probably a better phrase  I can always throw on a random episode of Always Sunny while I m cooking or something  but I can t exactly whip out Beloved while I m working from home ;1970
2999;2023-05-29 01:08:00;1.0;Biannual is once every two years  Biennial is twice in a year ;1555
3000;2023-05-28 22:39:00;1.0;That s fair   I imagine most sayings get mangled from their original intent and meaning   I happen to have  knowingly  bought both a Thucydides and a Kafka shirt with falsely attributed quotes  they sound like something they d say     In this case I think the original and modern derivation both have their place ;1029
