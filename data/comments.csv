149ra2jjo7haid;149ra2j;jo7haid;cantspellrestaraunt;15.06.2023 09:36;28.0;Finished this book last week  Loved it     I liked how Richard was an unreliable narrator  often on the periphery of the original group  His bias in representing the other characters  especially the twins  made sense in the narrative  and had me questioning so much of the story in the latter half    I liked how much of the book was left unanswered  regarding the initial murder  as well as Tartt s use of subtle supernatural elements throughout  especially with regards to the Bacchanal  The implication that the  Dionysus   figure  leading the group might have been Julian  or that Julian had more involvement than we were initially lead to believe  talking privately in Latin    with Henry in the garden   Or perhaps the true Dionysus figure was Henry  leader of the group  who spoke Ancient Greek more fluently than English  and went off with a noble Greek death in the end  Henry may very well have just been a genius level sociopath who felt justified in his actions by Julian s teachings  but had a crisis when Julian abandoned him    In the latter chapters  when driving on the road  the boys almost hit a wild cat  catamount   They argue about whether or not wild cats are actually in the area   This is the same area where the farmer was killed   It reveals just how little the group actually knows  and introduces a bit of doubt  How did Charles have a non human bite mark  Did the group chase a deer and disembowel it  attracting a cougar  Did the cougar attack the farmer    For how brilliant Henry was  remember that he didn t even know men had walked on the moon  The group is intelligent  but their focus is very limited ;109
149ra2jjo6osvn;149ra2j;jo6osvn;TemperatureRough7277;15.06.2023 03:27;36.0;I guess it depends on what you like in a book  No book is objectively amazing for every person that reads it  I just read To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf and it was not for me  It s literary genius  I know  but I personally just didn t have a fun time   What I loved about the Secret History was the story of obsession  the extremely vibey setting atmosphere  and how much fun I had following such unlikeable  horrible characters  The critique of academia is one of the  points  but it s not necessarily what made me love it  The novel is for sure a character study rather than one that excels in plot  so if you re a more plot focused reader  and you might be based on your comments about the lack of a twist and seeing the ending coming  you re probably not going to find it as immersive as someone who loves a character focused book ;810

149ra2jjo7xj9p;149ra2j;jo7xj9p;CaskofHorrors;15.06.2023 12:43;3.0;The secret history is sometimes over applauded for its depth and under applauded for it s character and plot complexity    I adore this book because the characters are absolutely masterful  Tartt is one of a long tradition of writers who create authentic  unique characters  and then places then situations where they become the most interesting versions of themselves   Bunny  for example  is a character who has been told his whole life that money is the most important thing in the world  but it is a crime to work for it  For her to create that character  then put him in a situation where he has 5 rich kids at his mercy is really genius   Another thing that s genius about the secret history is her use of an unreliable narrator  Like Fitzgerald s Nick Caraway  the more you re read the Secret History  the more you realise he lies about everything   A good example is how he portrays bunny  as this person who didn t really know what was coming   but the letter bunny sends to Julian tells you that he knew very well he was about to die and there was nothing he could do to stop it   Richard is the absolute worst of the Greek class   and the more you read the story the more you realise just how awful he is and how the entire story is him trying to justify his actions   TL DR   while not philosophically as deep as some people may think  the Secret History is fathoms deep in terms of character and plot complexity  You can read it a hundred times and find something new always   this is something great novels do ;1823
149ra2jjo828y3;149ra2j;jo828y3;captainmcpigeon;15.06.2023 13:24;2.0;I agree  To me the problem with this book is there is too much telling vs showing  All the juicy bits are narrated to the MC by other characters rather than immersing us in them directly  It takes away from the experience ;1851

13t9mhmjlu029w;13t9mhm;jlu029w;erminegarde27;27.05.2023 15:35;9.0;I have found I m able to listen to a lot heavier  more high brow books  For some reason  I need reading with a real book to be an enjoyable experience  so I stick to things I really like  Otherwise  I just won t pick the book up  I listen to audiobooks in the car on my commute and so I m stuck there  Sometimes  I eventually get into whatever educational thing I m forcing myself to listen to  and really expand my horizons  I m so damn fussy  I have trouble finding books I really like  I reread a lot   so Audible allows me to experiment too ;74
13t9mhmjltxns6;13t9mhm;jltxns6;Shuppilubiuma;27.05.2023 15:18;3.0;I only listen to fiction in audiobook form nowadays  simply because I can do other things when it s on and most of the books I want are available  The readings are good and I can lost in an audiobook as easily as an actual book  A lot of technical stuff is either dry as dust on audiobook or is unavailable in the format  so that s usually either physical book or ebook  History and science are around 50 50  largely due to whether they exist as an audiobook or not  Also  footnotes are crap on audiobook ;2124

13t9mhmjlvm2l5;13t9mhm;jlvm2l5;HellStoneBats;27.05.2023 22:57;1.0;Physical books  non fiction  very specific fiction I had as a child  maybe a tad of branching out   Audiobooks    select sword and sorcery or scifi libraries    sort by duration     select the longest titles that are single books    don t bother looking at the description    purchase   I ve only hated 1 so far ;1009
13t9mhmjlvygne;13t9mhm;jlvygne;kuzitiz;28.05.2023 00:43;1.0;Absolutely  I have finished poorly constructed books with amazing readers but have DNF the same books in the first chapter when reading for myself  That sounds awful but as a developmental editor  I almost always catch major holes in finished  published works that don t seem to bother me in an audio version ;85
13t9mhmjlwoykj;13t9mhm;jlwoykj;New-York-Mouse;28.05.2023 04:38;1.0;There s this type of audiobook voice I don t like at all and it s found in many modern mystery books with a female narrator  A type of  i m so bored with everything and better than everyone around me  vibe it gives off  It s probably something to do with the type of characters these books tend to have  maybe  But I can t do it anymore    I find audiobooks for classics easier and they have really  really talented narrators  This Jane Austin narrator was perfect for helping me understand stuff that might have went over my head if not for tone of voice  I also like nonfiction audiobooks better than reading nonfiction  Some audiobooks are just superbly acted in general  the Demon Copperhead audiobook is SO well performed    Now Terry Pratchett all the Discworld I m going through lately I have to use my eyes alone because half the jokes are visual and word puns and all that ;175
13t9mhmjly8yy3;13t9mhm;jly8yy3;ProtoJim;28.05.2023 15:04;1.0;I started listening to audiobooks with easy mysteries   other fiction  often something I d read in print years before so missing some wouldn t hurt since I m always doing something else like driving  mowing the lawn  weeding  etc   As my ability to process the audio got better  I moved into books I d wanted to read  but put me to sleep or were just impenetrable for some reason   I found I could listen to many of them although I still drift off on a few   Anyway  I started listening to more nonfiction until that was most of the books I read   I listened to a lot of The Great Course lecture series  too   So long as visuals aren t needed too often  they re great ;597
13t9mhmjm0ni6i;13t9mhm;jm0ni6i;torolf_212;29.05.2023 01:43;1.0;I listen to books on audible and usually while driving or at work if doing a menial task by myself  Since books cost the same regardless of length  and they pretty much serve to relieve boredom the duration of the book is much more important  Several audiobooks I ve passed up on because they re  10 hours and cost the same amount of money as something that is 20 30 hours   Very dense books I find I prefer on audiobook  I couldn t get into the game of thrones books because of how much time GRRM spends describing every little thing  there was no room left for me to imagine what was going on in any given scene  whereas the audiobooks were absolutely fine;30
13t9mhmjm18n5o;13t9mhm;jm18n5o;In_Cider;29.05.2023 04:53;1.0;The narration is a massive part of the experience  If the narrator repeatedly misreads or mispronounces words then it just pulls you out of it  You want to be able to focus less on the voice and more on the words ;1127

13t5pzsjlww3c4;13t5pzs;jlww3c4;leftai2000;28.05.2023 06:01;1.0;Louis L Amour was the author that got me into westerns  Eminently readable  kind of formulaic  easily digestible  This was in the ealy 70 s  At that time westerns were  was   a much larger genre than it is now  There were so many authors always available on the shelves in both libraries and bookstores  larger than science fiction fantasy in those days   Clair Huffaker  Max Brand  John Reese  and so many others  But westerns went out of  style  and many of those authors are out of print  and hard to find  I miss new books in the style of those days ;1779

13t5pzsjm0s7qn;13t5pzs;jm0s7qn;One-Age9528;29.05.2023 02:23;2.0;One of my favourite books of all time  I read it before even reading any of his fiction ;1622

13t5pzsjlvgq5u;13t5pzs;jlvgq5u;simplymatt1995;27.05.2023 22:12;2.0;The Walking Drum is his masterpiece in my opinion  One of the best historical novels of all time as far as I m concerned;464

13t5pzsjlveu8k;13t5pzs;jlveu8k;The_Lime_Lobster;27.05.2023 21:57;4.0;One of my favorite things about Lonesome Dove is that the action hits you right in the face when you least expect it  There were many times I had to reread a paragraph because my brain said  hold up  did that just happen   It s very character focused and takes its time getting going but the action definitely picks up ;1633
13t5pzsjlub45b;13t5pzs;jlub45b;TyrellSepi0l;27.05.2023 16:57;3.0;Lonesome Dove is one of the strangest books I ve ever read   plenty of times when I was reading it I was bored but whenever I put it down I was desperate to pick it up again because I loved the characters so much     My copy is 800 or so pages long and the story didn t even start until I reached the 200 s  the beginning was just a load of characters falling in love with the same prostitute ha     I ve literally just finished Dead Mans Walk  the first prequel  and enjoyed that much more ;2452
13t5pzsjlvgxk5;13t5pzs;jlvgxk5;simplymatt1995;27.05.2023 22:14;2.0;I think it could be considered more of a neo western;1799
13t5pzsjlvqplu;13t5pzs;jlvqplu;Mrschirp;27.05.2023 23:36;1.0;I remember feeling like the book in a meta way resembled the main character  Like it was almost a western  but instead was searching for where the  new  westerns belong in the modern world ;2107
13t5pzsjlx26cs;13t5pzs;jlx26cs;luinverse;28.05.2023 07:21;2.0;Exactly  i was driving from El Paso to Alburquerque  Definitely helped with the old west vibe        And acted audiobooks are amazing  I listened to this 25ish years ago so the memory is pretty vague  I just remember that it was really good   ;669
13t5pzsjlv9jol;13t5pzs;jlv9jol;Bubbarian;27.05.2023 21:14;5.0;You should absolutely read Lonesome Dove  So great ;718
13t5pzsjlvup68;13t5pzs;jlvup68;ProtoJim;28.05.2023 00:10;2.0;Could be or it works for you   not for me   I can be very picky   It s worth reading at least something like his  Riders of the Purple Sage  simply because it s referenced so much   That goes for a lot of the old ones   To our taste or not  they re part of the evolution of our current literature ;2273
13t5pzsjlvzdin;13t5pzs;jlvzdin;CannibalismIsNatural;28.05.2023 00:50;1.0;The Walking Drum is the only book of his I ve read  I m not really a fan of westerns  but someone recommended it to me  I wish he d have gotten to finish the series ;2211
13t5pzsjlus4gz;13t5pzs;jlus4gz;Disparition_2022;27.05.2023 19:01;3.0;It s only slow in the beginning  really  Once they actually get on the trail theres quite a lot happening all the time ;1291
13t5pzsjlvwx7m;13t5pzs;jlvwx7m;Mrschirp;28.05.2023 00:29;2.0;Fair point  My taste in books is also really odd sometimes    It is really interesting to read older works and process through where the writer was coming from and how their work is a product of the times  I read a ton of very old historical fiction for awhile from the 1870s 1890s and it was really fascinating to pick that apart ;2350
13t5pzsjluzww2;13t5pzs;jluzww2;halcyon_an_on;27.05.2023 20:00;3.0;This right here  The lead up to the cattle drive is necessary for the rest of the novel  but it is probably the only  boring  section overall ;1944
13t5pzsjlw4jbu;13t5pzs;jlw4jbu;ProtoJim;28.05.2023 01:34;3.0;My taste  too   We have horses  have always had them    I ve lived on a ranch in Colorado  so that can really damage books when the author just gets their  facts  from other fiction   I agree about the historical perspective  I find it fascinating  too  For about a decade now  I ve moderated the  Evolution of Science Fiction  group on  Goodreads com  https   Goodreads com  so it s a familiar topic with tech  social norms  etc   I m in my 60s   we ve had HUGE changes to the social norms during my lifetime    Stranger in a Strange Land   1962  by Heinlein was once held up as an example of a man promoting the equality of women  but most young readers think it s misogynistic   So it goes   ;270
13t5pzsjlwgydl;13t5pzs;jlwgydl;Mrschirp;28.05.2023 03:19;1.0;That s so interesting  I ll have to check Heinlen out   Rabbit trail here but I really think that s why the Dune movie that came out recently was so popular   it s based off of a book that s got a different perspective than the current culture  so it feels  new   even though it s actually old and that s why it s different  I haven t read the book  I know  I know  but I want to read it and compare book to movie and see what is the author and what s the director now ;2246
13t5pzsjlxlstp;13t5pzs;jlxlstp;ProtoJim;28.05.2023 11:46;2.0;I first read  Dune  in the 70s   have read it several times since   I recommend it as a standalone   I m not a fan of the sequels to the book which has spawned a huge  popular series   That includes the 2d book   Dune Messiah  which Herbert originally included in the first  I m in the minority  but editors can be an author s best friend   cutting that book out of the first was a huge improvement     I m not a fan of the latest movie  either   Great visuals  but it missed capturing the heart of the story  IMO  As bad as the 1984 movie is  it did a far better job in that area   The 2000 mini series wasn t bad either   If you re not familiar with the book  it s easy to miss  though   Heinlein s work prior to 1970 was heavily constrained by editors   publishers   He wrote fantastic short stories   juveniles  most prior to 1960   Both are worth reading as an adult   were particularly influential to my teenage years  They were filled with a lot of space adventures that were solved by science  logic    fidelity  A bit cheesy  probably more for guys rather than girls due to the main character s sex    Have Space Suit  Will Travel  has a fun female character with a fairly prominent role in it   so do  Tunnel In The Sky     The Star Beast        Heinlein wasn t much for diverse characters   He had one leading character of 3 ages   If they were female  they were just a guy with breasts   a cosmetic change only  I like the character   was more interested in the settings   solutions  so it works for me   Heinlein is another whose editors were his best friends   His first novel remained unpublished until after his death   It reads like his post 1970 novels where he could ignore the editors   publishers   It resulted in books that are overlong   preachy  I ll recommend  Stranger in a Strange Land   but read the original publication  not the one with all his original text restored   The extra words add nothing but time   irritation  IMO    The Moon is a Harsh Mistress  is a favorite of mine  His other books during the 1960s are a mixed bag   The first half of  Glory Road  is great fun   Farnaham s Freehold  is cringeworthy   The Door Into Summer  was good until I read his later works   then it becomes somewhat creepy   In 1970  Heinlein almost died from some brain problem   He wrote  I Will Fear No Evil  which should be avoided  After 1970  Heinlein got really weird about sex   started putting incestuous relationships in his books  Unlike his friend  Theodore Sturgeon  The couples belonged to the same nudist colony   he seems serious about promoting it   Just yuck   Sturgeon wrote a short story about it that is definitely worth reading  If All Men Were Brothers  Would You Let Your Sister Marry One      I m rambling   Enjoy ;67

13t3j5ejlu0ws9;13t3j5e;jlu0ws9;lucia-pacciola;27.05.2023 15:41;3.0;Sometimes    Sometimes it s because the series isn t really a series and won t ever finish  Like C  J  Cherryh s Alliance Union books  They re all part of the same setting  and all the stories are connected to the same shared history  But almost all of them can be read as standalone novels  The history of that setting won t ever be finished  The author will just stop writing at some point    Then there s Dune  which ended unfiinshed because the author died before publishing the conclusion  There s no way around that  If you read Dune  you ve started an unfinished series    On the other hand  there s series like GoT and KKC  which are unfinished not because the author s life ran out before the story did  but because the author s motivation ran out before the story did  And yeah  I started both of those  and the Gentlemen Bastards  too    And then there s stuff like Barry Eisler s John Rain books and their spinoffs  which always seem to circle back to John Rain at some point   Is the series finished  Who knows  Eisler s still writing  and could contribute another book to the  Rainiverse  at any time  When he does  I ll be there for it    In general  I try to avoid series that are supposed to have a conclusion  but don t  because the author lost interest  Series that are more open ended  or that were unfinished because the author dies  I will still read ;1857

13t3j5ejltwd0q;13t3j5e;jltwd0q;Doxie_Anna;27.05.2023 15:09;2.0;I read mysteries and they are almost always series  I have read many series that are 25 30 books with 1 published a year  Why put off the enjoyment of what s available to read now for decades as I wait for the series to finish   If characters are a problem  get a notebook or sketchbook and keep track as you read the series  You can make your own timeline and whatever else seems important   Happy reading ;2432
13t3j5ejltx64n;13t3j5e;jltx64n;terracottatilefish;27.05.2023 15:14;2.0;My position is that good writing is deserving of an audience whether it s a completely finished work or not  And even with series that finish strong  people remain engaged with those characters and stories and want to think about what happens next look at how much Harry Potter fanfic there is   It s a testament to books being good and worth reading that people want more    As I ve gotten older I ve gotten more philosophical about this  You can t guarantee that a series will be finished or finished well   Sometimes series start strong and finish strong  Sometimes the author finishes the series but the later books just aren t as good  or it ends in a way you don t like  Sometimes publishers don t want to keep a series going because of sales  Sometimes an author loses interest in a story or has other series going that sell better or has personal stuff going on that makes it hard to write   It s honestly kind of a miracle that any series gets finished   I try to appreciate what there is and not worry too much about whether it s done    Take ASOIF  for instance  I would love to know how it all wraps up  I would  But it doesn t mean I don t appreciate the world building or the characters or the intricate plotting or the sheer magnitude of the labor that went into what is already there  Should I not read great books because there aren t more of them   Or should I just appreciate what s available   Tl Dr it s the journey not the destination ;591

13t3j5ejltzt9r;13t3j5e;jltzt9r;zomgimonreddit;27.05.2023 15:33;0.0;The problem for me with a never finished series is I believe it violates an implicit promise to the reader    To me  typically if you are only reading a portion of the intended work  you often get only rising action  It s easier to create something if you only have to make rising action  with no thought put to resolution    For example  In the popular TV show Lost  they got viewers hooked by showing something strange and extraordinary  with the tacit agreement that its significance would later be explained  The polar bear appearing on a tropical island was weird and exciting  and because of the typical structure of narrative  the viewer had the expectation that it would be explained later in a satisfying and meaningful way    But instead of ever explaining the polar bear  JJ Abrams instead added new  exciting  shiny mysteries in an endless succession  never really explaining any of them  The final episode then was one of the most unsatisfying moments in television history  and many viewers considered it a fundamental betrayal of the compact between viewer and author    To me  GRRM and Rothfuss created incredible works  but they were only incredible to me with the expectation that they have some kind of meaningful  cohesive ending  Or  barring that  they might have an ending that goes counter to form and simply kills everyone  That  at least  would complete the piece    Failing to complete the series undermines the enjoyment  and I would say value  of the extant novels  It s not compelling or interesting to introduce say a new supernatural foe at the end of a novel if nothing else is ever revealed about them and they never affect the plot ;1397

13t3j5ejm0518a;13t3j5e;jm0518a;FirstOfRose;28.05.2023 23:10;2.0;Yes  plus you re missing out on some great unfinished series out there  And all for what  A grifter whose books aren t even all that great anyway and a guy whose series is basically pieces from English history and the rest heavily influenced  plagiarised   from another  If you want to know how ASOIAF will likely end  read Memory  Sorrow  Thorn by Tad Williams  Don t give Rothfuss money ;2044
13t3j5ejltcp2x;13t3j5e;jltcp2x;TheKOg77;27.05.2023 12:22;6.0;Yes that s a problem indeed  Few options to solve that   1  Some few books provide a recap at the start of it  recounting the most important events and characters  2  Reread the last book in the series to catch back up  3  Google a summary of the books so far  For big series like the Stormlight Archive there are lots of primers online to get you up to date again  4  Just jump back in without recapping  This obviously works better with simpler series and not as well for complex ones  Of course  none of these solutions are perfect  Primers are good but not available for all books  Still  I think it s worth it just to be able to experience more books and to not have to wait for multiple years for me series to be finished  It s a tradeoff I m willing to make ;2403
13t3j5ejltyhzf;13t3j5e;jltyhzf;UnaliveInsyde;27.05.2023 15:24;2.0;I just reread the books every couple of years so I can get back into it if George ever releases winds  Though at this point it seems like it will be finished by someone else some years down the line  George doesn t seem up to the task anymore ;1218

13t3j5ejm0a69v;13t3j5e;jm0a69v;Hefty-Emu1068;28.05.2023 23:51;2.0;I think I might try a read the one previous again  Or see if there are summaries on the internet perhaps  just need to be careful I don t find spoilers ;2051

13svyv2jlu1pm5;13svyv2;jlu1pm5;HugoNebula;27.05.2023 15:47;1.0;I think the issue is compounded by the classic Greek Roman literal and modern fictional interpretations of the phrase  If  in the first instance  it s literally God turning up to help out defeating the devil  I can t see how anyone can be surprised  if it s the second  even more so everything is spelled out in the preceding book  to the point that Stu Redman literally explains it to his companions before the denouement  I think too many readers want or expect a slam bang battle and resent having something they re required to think about ;699

13sd5xujlph8rg;13sd5xu;jlph8rg;YanniRotten;26.05.2023 14:59;99.0;A Hospital Visit Reveals Medieval Secrets Hidden in Books  Using CT scanning on 16th century books  researchers uncovered bits of parchment salvaged from handwritten manuscripts    Books within the portal of a CT scanner  with a person in medical garb including a blue smock  a mask and a hair covering behind a window in the background   Other methods of scanning Medieval books faced limitations so researchers decided to try CT scanning to see what fragments they concealed within their bindings Credit   Eric Ensley  By Katherine Kornei  May 23  2023  Even in medieval times  recycling was in vogue  Bits of parchment salvaged from older handwritten manuscripts were often used to reinforce other books  Using CT scanning  a team of researchers has now shown that those medieval leftovers hidden beneath some books  covers can be seen  Studying these medieval binding fragments can help reveal how  when and where early books were assembled  and there s always the tantalizing possibility of finding a previously unknown manuscript   In Europe  books were reproduced by hand up until the middle of the 15th century  Known as manuscripts   the Latin root  manu  means  hand    those written records were often works of art in their own right  with multiple colors of ink flowing across meticulously prepared sheets of calf  goat or sheep skin   However  with the printing press becoming common in Europe in the 1450s there wasn t much of a need for such manuscripts  But some book binders opted to reuse their parchment pages    They could use the older  more durable manuscript to help reinforce the structure of a new printed book   said Eric Ensley  the curator of rare books and maps at the University of Iowa   Binders would cut pieces of parchment   sometimes full pages  sometimes just thin strips   and glue them on places like a book s spine  The book would then be covered  and most of those binding fragments would be hidden from view    There s actually a whole library within a library in the form of these fragments   said Joris Dik  a materials scientist who studies binding fragments at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and was not involved in the new study   In recent decades  researchers have begun peering beneath book covers using noninvasive techniques to to find medieval binding fragments and read what s written on them  But many of those techniques have limitations  which prompted Dr  Ensley and his colleagues to try CT scanning  the same kind available in a hospital  The technique s three dimensional view solves the focus problems that plagued other methods  and a scan can be completed in seconds rather than the hours previously required   Image A three book set of a 16th century encyclopedia of animals was taken from the University of Iowa s archives and put into a CT scanner at the university s medical college  Credit   Eric Ensley  The team scanned a three book set of  Historia animalium   an encyclopedia of animals printed in the 16th century  One book would serve as a control  the researchers decided  because its cover was damaged and could be peeled back to reveal medieval binding fragments   featuring red and black ink   on the spine  The other two books were intact  However  the researchers hypothesized that their spines might also contain fragments because the books appeared to have been bound in the same workshop  said Katherine H  Tachau  a historian at the University of Iowa and a member of the research team   Under the watchful eye of Giselle Simon  the conservator at the University of Iowa Libraries  the team placed the three books on the bed of a CT scanner in the lab of Eric Hoffman at the university s Carver College of Medicine  The books fit with room to spare  and scanning all three took under a minute   With Dr  Tachau  Dr  Ensley watched the hidden text of some of the binding fragments being revealed on the scanner s screen    We both leaned in and started reading the Latin together   he said   It was a goose bumps moment    Image Many of the fragments found in the scans came from a Latin Bible that was handmade centuries before the printed books used in the experiment Credit   Eric Ensley  Many of the medieval binding fragments in the  Historia animalium  came from a Latin Bible dating to the 11th or 12th century  the team reported in April in the journal Heritage Science   When the researchers analyzed the CT scans of their control book  they found that letters written in red ink were most pronounced in the images  Darker inks  however  did not show up as clearly  The different chemicals in the inks affect how they absorb X rays  But by varying the energy of X rays emitted by a CT scanner  it might be possible to better detect black inks in future studies  Dr  Ensley and his collaborators hypothesize   The fragments the team uncovered will be ultimately digitized in Fragmentarium  an online repository of more than 4 500 medieval binding fragments  The archive is a way to disseminate the information contained in these hidden pieces of history  said William Duba  a historian at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland who coordinates Fragmentarium    The spines of books are hiding treasures   he said ;1679

14af46djoad94g;14af46d;joad94g;hashbrowns_;15.06.2023 23:35;58.0;hey man first things first  dont kick yourself over it  theyre just stories meant to be enjoyed reading is a private pleasure and all that matters whether you are getting something out of it  Likewise  there will always be books you like that others dont and vice versa so dont worry about the experience of others   being a little more specific to lovecraft personally hes a favourite of mine but hes definitely not eveyones cup of tea  I might go as far as to say hes a marmite author  often the very things that put people off him are the very things that others like about him so dont worry if arent enjoying his style  at least you gave him a go   now if you do decide to keep reading heres a couple of things to bear in mind about his style  you almost sound as though you feel guilty about your imagination failing you but in a sense this is exactly what lovecraft intends  not only are descriptions kept purposely vague but his stories are written from the perspective of a character trying to put into words something that they themselves cannot comprehend never mind describe accurately  Often the protagonist is driven mad with terror at what he sees  Many others feel shame at the idea of telling others about something so unbelievable perhaps only admitting to it in memoirs after their death  Most are worldly and learned men and still their powers of description fail them  so otherworldly are things they see or hear   What im trying to get at is that  for me at least  the fun of lovecraft is precisely that you are along for the ride with a rational and serious gentleman who does not want to accept the world shattering and indescribable things he is experiencing but is forced to confront or accept them while words fail them  so basically  if you cant precisely picture what the character is seeing thats because the character doesnt really know what he was seeing and is simply doing his best to put into everyday words something quite beyond ordinary experience   the other really fun part of lovecraft is that  though most stories or mini series are totally standalone  there is a larger mythos that you gradually piece together from each seemingly unrelated story which can make re reading very rewarding   just had a look at the list of stories in the particular book youre reading and ive got to say its an oddly ordered muddle of his stories  id recommend leaving anything randall carter or dream cycle till later  nyarlathotep and celephais are particularly out there and are quite literally meant to be dreamscapes so dont worry that you cant picture them  youre not really supposed to   anyway I hope you give him another chance  he holds a special place in my heart and on my bookshelf   ;300

13ue5iljm09do4;13ue5il;jm09do4;Pereger;28.05.2023 23:45;5.0;I can assure you that it s not precision  At least  not in every case  For example  he uses hyemal as a noun  That can be art  but it s not precision  There are absolutely more precise words to use   This is a first person story  so the language should fit the character s vocabulary  rather than the author s    That s my point  really  It doesn t seem to fit the character      I ll admit it can be more difficult and slow things down  even less enjoyable  but in the long run I think it s a plus overall    I feel as though you re missing my point  I have no problem with people using challenging words  and I even named a couple of books that do it in a way that makes sense   I was talking about this particular book ;1066
13ue5iljm0h3gz;13ue5il;jm0h3gz;Pereger;29.05.2023 00:49;4.0;I actually made a mistake  Pontonier wasn t in the book  It was ponton   Here s the sentence    The car was a desert colored  rusted out Ford of the 40s  ponton and streamlined       Do you know what that means   Also   logopoeic  propaedeutic  patriotic sentiments were emanating from her      Do you know those ones  If so  I m pretty impressed   EDIT  Apparently the person I m replying to here has blocked me        So that seems to mean that not only can I not reply to that person  I can t seem to reply to anyone in this entire part of the conversation  All these people are saying things to me  but I can t seem to reply to any of them  So weird ;761

13ue5iljm0imv7;13ue5il;jm0imv7;Pereger;29.05.2023 01:01;2.0;You mean you didn t find my list of words to be obscure  Or that  while reading the book  you didn t notice that the vocabulary was obscure   Because I can totally understand just getting into the book without noticing those words  But if you mean that the list that I mentioned in my post doesn t contain obscure words  and I ve added ponton   used as an adjective  logopoeic  and propaedeutic   then I can t agree   As for what I m used to reading  all I can say is that I read everything ;2321

13ue5iljm0iuu3;13ue5il;jm0iuu3;Ron_deBeaulieu;29.05.2023 01:03;0.0;  Pontonier  This is a word  It s a worker in the construction of a pontoon     A ponton  in that context  is an old timey car design  https   en wikipedia org wiki Ponton  car    Logopoeic is a use of words in poetry for more than their literal meaning  Propaedeutic means prep studies  Without knowledge of the surrounding paragraph  I can only guess that this means that she was expressing inarticulate  partially informed  maybe meaning that she had a sophomoric level of knowledge    patriotic sentiments     ETA  Well  maybe not  inarticulate   but more like she was using words that sounded good without thinking too much about whether they conveyed her meaning     ETA2  Link about ponton car body added ;934
13ue5iljm22w1o;13ue5il;jm22w1o;monkeysuffrage;29.05.2023 11:19;1.0;I would probably glide over  ponton   but just because I have an idea of what 40 s Fords look like  somewhat pontoon like   and the others have cognates that bring something to mind  more or less    We don t always have to know exactly what words mean to get a feel for them  we absorb new words over time  organically   just like children do    I think it works actually  I think that words that I don t quite know  can still sound nice  and still  like  paint a picture  or whatever ;1924
13ue5iljm4mwzv;13ue5il;jm4mwzv;Pereger;29.05.2023 22:38;2.0;With that repsonse  it s very hard to believe that you read my whole post  or even my whole comment  Will you read this one all the way   Or my post  Not sure whether you noticed  but I mentioned Nabokov in my post    But he didn t make Lolita  for one example  talk like a university professor  He was aware that different characters have different voices and different levels of vocabulary    When Nabokov  or any good writer  has a character use a certain level of vocabulary  it s not solely because of a love of language  but also because he wants us to understand something about that character    Different characters have different levels of vocabulary    For some reason  you seem to think that I want to read ordinary words only and am complaining about learning new words  I can t understand how you d think that if you re actually reading what I write    That s a complete misunderstanding of my point ;1631
13ue5iljm0jscn;13ue5il;jm0jscn;Pereger;29.05.2023 01:11;10.0;Sorry  I m not asking you to give me definitions  I m asking whether you know those words off the top of your head  and don t consider them to be obscure   As for ponton  my OED tells me that it s a noun or a verb  The noun  ponton  is just an out of date way to spell pontoon  It s how some people spelled it in the 1800s and earlier  It s not an adjective  but ok  he used it that way   But I don t think it means out of date at all in this context  I think it means it resembles a pontoon   After all  the novel is set in the 50s  so the car wasn t really that out of date  It was past its heyday  but it didn t mean old timey  I understand why you guessed that  though   And the fact that you guessed that answers my question about how obscure it is   EDIT  I know that pontonier is a word  That word wasn t in the book ;951

13ue5iljm0t5n3;13ue5il;jm0t5n3;Ron_deBeaulieu;29.05.2023 02:31;1.0;A ponton is a style of car that was fashionable in that era  it is old timey for today  I didn t mean that it was old timey then   https   en wikipedia org wiki Ponton  car     I was guessing because it sounded like the author was being ironic in his description  but I wasn t sure  If that character was a child  then it was age appropriate for her to that  but if it was an adult  then he was mocking     ETA  I didn t want to mislead you if you were trying to parse out the meaning of the passage  that s why I was hedging  Just trying to help you out   I do know these words off the top of my head  but context can change connotation  ;735

13ue5iljm0w3a4;13ue5il;jm0w3a4;Ron_deBeaulieu;29.05.2023 02:55;2.0;That might explain it  The words didn t seem unusual to me  but I read a lot of police procedurals from that era  and I think you re right  the word choice was very different back then ;1823

13ue5iljm11kuy;13ue5il;jm11kuy;Pereger;29.05.2023 03:44;1.0;Sounds like it means about what I figured   As for the character  he wasn t a child  or being ironic or mocking  He was an adult just describing the car    if you were trying to parse out the meaning of the passage  Yeah  I wasn t  My post is about how the character doesn t talk like that  or give any indication that he would write like that  but then narrates the story like that   When you said that you know all those words that I listed  I just pointed out that I d added some more and was curious whether you knew all of them  too ;1421

13ua0y9jm0v333;13ua0y9;jm0v333;Starkrossedlovers;29.05.2023 02:47;0.0;This might be true to every big reader  but personally there is a specific dream story i see as my ideal  My favorite books have only ever touched parts of my ideal but never the full  The books that are closest i read over to get back that specific feeling when things go right exactly how you wanted it to  The edibles are starting to kick in so i might type too long and this makes less and less sense as i go on I m about to take another one right now  It s all subjective because remember it s a specific feeling  In your mind as you read you are thinking of how you d like the story to end  For me  it s really difficult to enumerate in words and in an altered mental state  One book  like Eragon touches a bit of it  A world with magic that s more extensive than simple bibbidty boppity boo stuff  But still it touched it a little too    I also read a necromancy book where there are powers in the modern world  But necromancy is not seen as strong and most die because you need to be close to death to use it and they have short lifespans  But turns out it s stronger than usual  Typical underdog turns op story  But it scratches a part of the ideal   I love reading the light novels  Release that Witch   And reincarnated with an ai chip or something  The former because the romance is great and the women are treated like people  But it s a male centered well done romance  I like romance and I m a guy  But most of the more well done romance is made with women protags  Of course the former was made by a woman so that s probably why it s great  but it scratches that itch  Also  there s the underdog shtick plus he ll never be op because he can t use magic  He s a normal guy  But he s using the power of the witches  He s a brain  so are some of the witches  Anna is my dream partner  so he s physically normal in a world of beholders demons as genetically enhanced brain dead paladins and powerful witches  It s so good  But my complaint is that we don t see him grappling nearly with the consequences of him directing death as much as I d like  He saved the whiches so they are blindly loyal  He s always correct  It s a shame because when it s tested  they seem mindless  Doesn t fulfill ideal  I ve read this many dozens of times   There s one about a guy with a gambling addiction  has been disowned by most of not all of his family  But he manages to get into a fantasy ish world as a merc for hire  He becomes a hero in that world but still needs to face the consequences and reconcile with his family  Seeing him overcome a foe and be looked at as a trusted leader but still fumbling his words when apologizing to his little sister for abandoning her to gamble is so emotionally riveting  But they introduce characters from another series who harms one of my favorite characters for no reason and treats her like shit  And they are supposed to be good guys and no apology  Author just treats it normally  Misses the ideal    This light novel called  The Death Mage that Doesn t Want a Third Time   Man  Again i say its all subjective  Some may disagree  But this light novel is the closest to filling most of my ideal  You have the perspective of a person that deserves revenge  wants it  but prefers to let it go  The characters he deserves revenge on are good people  They are all different and well fleshed out and their increasingly varied reasons for stopping the mc are reasonable when you consider   Our mc is insane  The death mage has been driven crazy both by his past existences and his unique affinity to death  Thing is his warped view of life is normal if you look at it from his perspective  He has undead  zombie friends  These zombies cannibalize  He s keeping his mother from death to bring her back to life  an affront to  some  gods  The sort of creatures around him have warped his sense of normal  So if his zombies eat you  what s wrong  You eat other animals and don t heed their cries  All souls are equal  Speaking on that  the big reason why he s dangerous  he can interact with and break souls  See  the universe has reincarnation  Souls were meant to be things that couldn t be created or destroyed  But a demon lord with the ability to break souls attacked and nearly destroyed the gods  Now our mc comes later with it   If a baby had the ability to destroy the world with a thought at 6 years old  what sort of moral dilemma would you have in deciding to kill it or let it live  How about if this baby s perspective and way of seeing life is significantly different than yours  And what if your kind caused significant harm to them  You have the chance to stop it now given all that  Do you   Now what if the baby tells you it won t destroy anything  Would you trust them  Should you force others to  Would you understand if others didn t  And would you agree with the baby to treat you as an enemy if you didn t stop the others from hurting it given that  That s our dilemma  Trust and morality  Or survival    Lastly there s a relatively new one i read  A light novel that has a reincarnated kid  And one who actually tells his parents  And they actually react normally  The mom freaks at the idea of the boy sucking her breast when he was really a 40 year old stranger  The dad wondering if the mc killed the soul of his real kid and is wearing the body like a suit  And the mc  the target of this questioning  rightly becoming distressed  He grew to see them as his parents  That s just a small thing i liked  They reconcile later  The big thing is the deep storytelling and setup of politics and shit  and then war destroying all that from people from a continent with a completely different society and magic system  The really long war  the dehumanizing of this new side we ve just met with the mc after learning all the intricacies of OUR L  the mc and reader s  culture  The first part immerses you so deep into the world building  when the invasion of an unknown society happens  you are on the mcs side as though you re a countryman  You dehumanize with him  grieve with him  You hate the OTHERS with him  Then the story changes  Now it s the perspective of other side  The mc is forced there  He has to go undercover and find a way back  We hate the girl he meets who helps him out  Both we and the mc look at her with disgust when she speaks of her military brother with worry  And we both begin to humanize her after we see how much more like us she is  We are having this change in opinion right  Slowly starting to humanize  and as the symbol of the war  he can change things  However the story still shows us stuff is going on on our original country  The mc was taken by those animals  The reader is now shocked at the words now knowing how human the others truly are  Their hate grows since the war is still continuing  While you and the mc s hate disappears  your family  people and loved ones deepens  Now the reader gets to see words they had previously normalized and accepted  in a light after that otherization and it s embarrassing  It s not done so i gotta wait for more chapters  What will happen when mc comes back    So I ve forgotten the point of this comment but yea i look for the ideal peace;1129

13ua0y9jm1gnr7;13ua0y9;jm1gnr7;UrQuanKzinti;29.05.2023 06:25;-18.0;Except it IS the same river      Books are an author s thoughts  frozen in time  replicated and reproduced year over year   They are wholly different from a river which is ever changing and evolving   The only way your metaphor would work is if the subject was an oral story  not a written one  then the teller would change as the river does ;1043
13ua0y9jm0c5o2;13ua0y9;jm0c5o2;This_Adeptness_8823;29.05.2023 00:08;-57.0;I disagree with the metaphor  geographically it is the exact same river  and biologically   dang it  I can t comprehend that kind of logic  I want to believe the essence soul spirit DNA of said man is the exact same as well   Thus  his memory of the river will be very similar  and he may well see physical changes around  yet it is the same location  the same source of water  the same river  the same man   We can insert our feelings  embellish our memories and arrive at a result that needs to much work to get to in the first place   Looking at the world simplistically when needed can save a lot of work   So  the same book  same paragraphs  same characters  same pages   I m not opposed to re reading at all  more people should be reading even if it takes re reading  I simply cannot do it myself and I have attempted many times over many years ;1792

13tyx1yjly77xl;13tyx1y;jly77xl;patrick_lansing;28.05.2023 14:51;24.0;Oooh  So  I really think The Wind up Bird Chronicle is Murakami s magnum opus  It was written at his sweet spot of history  when he was spitting out bangers left and right   I have faint memories of reading WUBC  but all I remember from it are these amazing scenes  The Thieving Magpie  for example  that I learnt to whistle because I had read the book  The thought sitting down at the bottom of a well  and feeling yourself losing contact from a material world    these things really hit hard   Plot specific questions are really not the way to read Murakami s works  It s more about something sort of  happens  and then you try to understand it  fail and move one with consequences  It s kinda like real life   So  these are symbolic  metaphorical stories  The Wind up bird sings its song  and then spring comes in  and time moves  and when it stops singing  the world then changes i e  something major happened in Toru s life  his world sort of stopped  Because  the bird is like a Wind up mechanism that turns the key to wind up the spring that moves our mechanical world  And Toru is caught at a time when there were no more turns left on the spring  His world is stuck  and he is stuck in his life in a very bad position   The Wind up bird is also a harbinger of bad times to come  Cinnamon could also hear it  and loses her voice when she couldn t any more   So  that s how I interpret the WUBC  I have to read it once again in order to remember exactly what happened  Only then will I be able tell more things about it ;283
13tyx1yjly9vv8;13tyx1y;jly9vv8;justalilargentinean;28.05.2023 15:10;9.0;I loved the book but  just like with many of Murakami s works  I feel like you could over analyse the hell out of it from a hundred different povs and yet never reach a palpable consensus  As Toru ponders towards the end   Everything was intertwined  with the complexity of a three dimensional puzzle   he muses   a puzzle in which truth was not necessarily fact and fact not necessarily truth     I think the place beyond the well is something between Toru s consciousness and a melting pot of people who have been  defiled  by Noboru Wataya  It is clear throughout the book that Toru is the complete opposite of N W   so it isn t outrageous to believe they might ve shared some sort of psychic connection  beyond the well   which would explain their visceral dislike and contempt for one another  Perhaps the dream world is a place where consciousnesses clash  It also acts for Toru as a place for self understanding and  ultimately  self confrontation  I m of the belief that the man knocking heavily on the door of Room 208  or was it 280  I forget  was Toru himself  just a version of himself that he wasn t yet ready to accept  The first time he enters this dream world and hears the knock  he is ushered out by the mysterious woman  pressed against that gelatinous wall  after which he d re emerge in the real world with the mark on his face  I see this mark as a sign of Toru s inability to accept himself  to face up to his fears and demons and shame  and a challenge to show his true self to the world with his face held up high  If you take into account the  emasculating  position Toru finds himself in at the beginning of the book  jobless  taking care of the house  doing chores and laundry while his wife is at work putting bread on the table  it d make sense that there d be parts of himself he d be particularly less keen on accepting  I say emasculating in the context of 90 s Japanese culture  where the men are expected to work gruelling jobs for hours on end with the aim to amass as much money and prestige as possible   So he runs away from himself and he gains the mark  Throughout the book we slowly see him discover different facets of himself as his world opens up more and more characters pass through his life  we see him use his psychic powers  for lack of a better term  to help these ailing women  again contrasting with the power driven way in which Noboru Wataya uses his apparent gift  We see him spend a lot of time in introspection  down in the well  sitting at the bench where he first met Nutmeg  It s no wonder that when he finally decides to confront the man behind the door and wins  that his mark disappears  It is also why  Kumiko  was so adamant about him not shining his light on the man s body afterwards  this man was  as I see it  bearing Toru s face and made from the darkest parts of Toru s soul  the same  thing  that slipped its way to the front seat during the incident with the guitar man  who I d argue wasn t a man at all but a personification of Toru s suffering   By destroying this Thing  Toru effectively faces himself  and comes out victorious and at peace with his self  thus the mark has served its purpose and is no longer needed    As for the Wind Up Bird  I m a little at a loss  Birds symbolise freedom  and are a recurring theme in the book  From the aforementioned Wind Up Bird  to the bird statue outside the house  to the Thieving Magpie song the waiter likes to whistle  The latter having its origin in a story where a bird s seemingly insignificant action  stealing cutlery  leads to the imprisonment of a servant  a single moment s action has a ripple effect which changes this woman s entire life  Cause and effect  invisible threads connecting our characters  N W  sending Kumiko to Malta Kano  Toru learning of defilement of Creta Kano by N W   Kumiko seeing the cat s disappearance as a sign that things have taken a turn for the worse  the mark on the veterinarian s face  Toru and Creta s prostitution storyline  the empty box intertwining Lieutenant Mamiya and Toru s fates and their respective relationships with being underground   The Wind Up Bird is a sign  or a reminder   of events that reverberate throughout timelines and lives  Toru Okada s cat disappears  so Noboru Wataya brings in Malta Kano  so Kumiko leaves him  so he finds the well  so he kills his other self in the dream world  so Kumiko kills Noboru Wataya  All this is specially relevant when keeping in mind Japan s involvement in WWII  something that Murakami got a lot of flack for trying to realistically depict in WUBC  This excerpt from an analysis says it best   The characters  willingness  or not  to confront uncomfortable truths  and the selective and self serving role of memory in human consciousness is another key theme  Toru and the others talk continuously about not being able to remember  and the desirability of forgetting unpleasant things   Forget me   Kumiko  and nearly everyone else  says to Toru about his marriage  but still he insists on the truth of his relationship  Accordingly  the ugly truths of Japanese military history insist on belching to the surface  demanding to be heard   At the end of the day I think the Wind Up Bird is there as a sort of reminder of the things that have been  the things that are  and the ways in which these will affect the things that Will Be    I only finished it a couple of days ago and I already think it merits a re read  I will get to it someday  and hopefully afterwards I ll be able to peel away another layer of this novel ever so carefully  like skinning a peach  and reach a more fruitful conclusion ;1777

13tyx1yjm3i3mu;13tyx1y;jm3i3mu;patrick_lansing;29.05.2023 17:54;1.0;This is such a splendid analysis  I think you ve hit upon the all the major conflicts and themes of this wonderful book   A bit more insight can be gather regarding the Wind up Bird itself if we look at the original name of the book   In Japanese the book is called              nejimakidori chronicles   Literally         nejimaki   is  Screw Winding    Screw Turning        maki   is a verb usually associated with  roll    turn    winding  but also with  volume   as in  volumes of a book    So  there is definitely an aspect of the  Mechanistic World  in the subtext  And it is everywhere in the book   But  also  it is the chronicles of a screw that is tightening across the pages  An inevitable conclusion  Kumiko s unfaithfulness  N W  s evil  that is spread across the volumes of a book  Perhaps  this is a bit of a stretch  but I can totally see how Murakami used the wordplay here ;1423

13tjpo8jm8zgwi;13tjpo8;jm8zgwi;weattt;30.05.2023 20:30;2.0;Maybe she just needs to process that you are simply not into her books and how she does things  Sometimes people just have to get over their disappointment and need to  self  reflect a bit   If this is at the core of your friendship  the friendship might not hold  And if it isn t  this time she might be spoiling the friendship with you  And you might end up being okay with it   From what you described  it just seemed exhausting  Daily pressure  being forced to cater to her to prevent tantrums  To do as she wished of you  But it was one sided  she didn t respect  your  wishes  Not even the simple boundary of not spoiling   She was the star of the show  you were her audience  A solo activity for her  though not intentionally   when you were seeking something mutual and balanced   At least when it comes to this  you two are very incompatible ;162

13tir0qjlxgjl6;13tir0q;jlxgjl6;Dazzling-Ad4701;28.05.2023 10:41;1.0; can t say that I ve ever taken any situation from a story and applied it to my own life       for me  I think it s more common that I take the character as they come off the page  and I try to apply my mind to  their  life    that s the whole thing that reading s about   that s where the stretch and the reward sense comes from     side rant   it really irritates me when people come with that weird flex of  you must not be empathetic  like me   if you don t  like   relate  to the character   no  maybe you re just too self obsessed to see anything past your own skin     I ll never be George Smiley or Ivan Denisovich or Ishmael  but I want to be able to understand what it  would be  to be them   if I was them  but I m not   somewhere in there is a stretch where the bullshitometer goes off  ofc    and then I get scornful or critical    but it s based more on some mental model of internal cohesiveness  and not so much on  well   huff  flounce  iiiiii  would never do such a thing so this author is Bad  ;2204

13tir0qjmchio6;13tir0q;jmchio6;thick-woolensocks;31.05.2023 15:02;1.0;Interesting thoughts  I kind of disagree with the quote   It can be an emotional experience reading about a character that has been through something similar to what I have been through  or responded to something in a way that is similar to how I have responded to something  Sometimes it is a comfort and can make me feel a little less alone  but sometimes it is also thought provoking because those relatable characters or plot lines cause me to reflect on my own life  the things I ve done  decisions I ve made  and why    I don t think I have to be reading about something I can t relate to in order to be challenged or thoughtful and reflective  I think there is a lot of value in being able to make connections between characters or stories and real life    Also  sometimes I read books just to be entertained and not to learn anything and that s okay too  In fact  many of those purely fun  and not challenging  books include characters that I do not relate to at all because they are unrealistic and it just isn t that deep    So  all in all  I think that whether the characters are relatable or not is not directly connected to whether a book is challenging and thought provoking or not  It could be either or  and I m enjoy them all ;357

13wdvwbjmb43at;13wdvwb;jmb43at;shonogenzo;31.05.2023 06:54;25.0;The Iliad was originally performed rather than read  hence the repetitive nature  and the audience would have been familiar with the major characters and the general story  So it s a very different thing for us  If you do keep on with it I would think of reading it as a window into a different world  rather than reading it for what we usually want out of a novel  empathy with characters  plotting etc  ;2206
13wdvwbjmb48xf;13wdvwb;jmb48xf;gnatsaredancing;31.05.2023 06:56;12.0;You re not missing anything  The Iliad is basically a who s who and who did what of a big war  Anyone who was anyone showed up for the siege of Troy and the Iliad is essentially the record of their deeds to give credit where credit s due   So if you re not interested in tracing all of these people and their deeds  the story won t hold that much interest   The second major hurdle is that the Iliad is a poem  It s meant to be spoken  not read  And when poems get translated  there s always a conflict  Do you go with the most literal translation even if it means modern readers might not grasp the metaphors  The translation that captures the poetry even if it means departing further from the original text  Or even a translation that tries to recapture the feel or reciting the poem   For example  there s a wonderful passage where Homer compares the ranks of the army to waves in the sea  And he intentionally fills the sentences with rolling vowels and liquid sssounds   Some translations try to use modern similes for the visuals  others try to capture the rolling sloshing sound of the sentences   https   www newyorker com books page turner englishing the iliad grading four rival translations   So yeah  if you re just reading the Iliad for an exciting story  you might come away disappointed  But there s much more to it than that  if you care to dig it out ;922

13wdvwbjmculke;13wdvwb;jmculke;[deleted];31.05.2023 16:26;1.0;This is how I teach it  the idea of Greek honor in warfare includes insane violence  taking as much as you can from the enemy  including rape and murder  Yet  What makes a Greek hero the most heroic is how much he suffers  Everything up until Book 24 echoes the idea of honor in warfare which is the entirety of the conflict in book 1 and of course book 5 would focus on how adept in warfare Diomedes is  because that makes him a great Greek hero per the terms of the culture  But nothing in books 1 21 show how much a hero has suffered   But if you look at this through the tragic hero lens  you begin to see things change as early as book 9  When the other soldiers try to convince Achilles to return  he begins changing his tune about being the best warrior and deserving the most  He tells them that basically whether you re good at fighting or not  we all end up the same  This is echoed in Troy when he tells Patroclus that all the souls of the men he s killed are waiting for him on the Styx   they say   welcome brother    implying he feels he is equal to the other soldiers  Even in Book 1  he asks Agamemnon why he s even there  the Trojans haven t bothered him or taken his things  so what s the point of the war   But the turning point  the peripeteia of the tragic hero cycle is when he violates Greek and Trojan death rituals in book 22  This is where his hubris has led him to make really wrong decisions  thus initiating the downfall  But before the downfall  the tragic hero has an anagnorisis or sudden understanding  This happens in book 24 for Achilles  when he breaks down and sobs over what he s done and what his father would think of him  He does the amazing  heroic by our standards thing and he acts like a decent human being   But what s most important is the last line of book 24  Thus was the funeral of Hector  breaker of horses   If this poem is all about how amazing Greek fighters are  why did Homer end the poem with a line about a Trojan  Because what Achilles and Hector were fighting for were vastly different things and Achilles understood that in the end  I make this point to my kids  noting that the general idea is Homer  a Greek  understood and empathized with a Trojan  whose land was destroyed  it s people hurt  all because Mycenae wanted trade routes  So this makes Hector the true  epic hero and Achilles the tragic hero   So  yes  It s anti war ;1712

13w9v42jmala5f;13w9v42;jmala5f;AlunWeaver;31.05.2023 03:33;64.0;Yeah  people talk about Nabokov as if he were a non native speaker but the guy had an aristocratic background and spoke English  French  and Russian from childhood on   The problem with Nabokov  for ESL readers  is that they are reading a guy who idolized Joyce  and even a fluent conversationalist in English will have trouble with that level of prose ;1160

13w3z5vjm9n7po;13w3z5v;jm9n7po;suelynntan;30.05.2023 23:11;18.0;Thank you for your kind words and it s a great question  As the story is about immortals  I preferred not to tie them down to any specific age as I imagine they would not think of time the same way as we do for example  to them  a decade might feel like a year  A large part of  Daughter of the Moon Goddess  is Xingyin  coming of age   and I think of her as the equivalent of someone in her late teens  growing to a young woman as the story develops    It s been absolutely surreal seeing the book translated into other languages   the Italian edition released yesterday  and the French one earlier this year  And it s especially meaningful to me that the book will also be translated into Chinese  Traditional   While it would also be an absolute dream to see the story onscreen  I m am not aware of anything on that front at the moment ;2396
13w3z5vjm9lybe;13w3z5v;jm9lybe;suelynntan;30.05.2023 23:02;15.0;I ve always loved the legend of Chang e   one that s often retold during the Mid Autumn Festival  Her image would be on lanterns  mooncake boxes  and children in Hong Kong learn poems and songs about her too  This story is one that stayed with me over time  perhaps because of its tragic ending when Chang e flies to the moon  I always wondered why Chang e took her husband s elixir and though there were several reasons in the legends  I kept wondering if there might be more behind her decision  From there  I imagined what if she and Houyi had a child  what she would be like  and what she would do to save her mother ;1985
13w3z5vjm9qfhz;13w3z5v;jm9qfhz;suelynntan;30.05.2023 23:35;9.0; Hi   I adore your books  Heart of the Sun Warrior was one of the best books I read last year and the amount of moments that made me cry omg          I m going to ask something that has intrigued me since the moment I read the book  How did you manage to write such a good love triangle  Did you always knew it was going to be a love triangle  I m curious because it feels so natural and that s such a great way to add a romance in a fantasy book  Can t wait to read more books written by you   Thank you so much for reading the books and I m so happy you liked them  I must admit I cried during the writing of the story too    I love this question  In  Daughter of the Moon Goddess   I didn t set out to write a love triangle   in my mind it was more sequential relationships that were not fully resolved  though it certainly evolved in  Heart of the Sun Warrior   In my mind  love can be complicated  unpredictable  and sometimes irrational  Emotions can linger long after we want them to  I imagined how the characters might feel in such a situation  how they might react  and how it could change them  I wanted the relationships to feel organic and natural  though this situation can also lead to a lot of angst ;300
13w3z5vjm9tgyj;13w3z5v;jm9tgyj;suelynntan;30.05.2023 23:57;3.0;Thank you   Am so happy you loved the books  I have a tv film agent who is wonderful  and this is one of those dreams that are in the  improbable but would be so incredible  category  When I write  I tend to visualize things in my head as well  and it would be amazing to see the story on the screen and the kingdoms imagined brought to life ;857
13w3z5vjm9obxh;13w3z5v;jm9obxh;suelynntan;30.05.2023 23:19;14.0;Thank you so much for reading the book  and I hope you liked the osmanthus jelly  I ve written a story inspired by the Chinese legend of Lady White Snake  though it will likely be published after the book I m currently working on  The next full length book is set in the same world but featuring different main characters  I love weaving other myths into the stories  as with the Four Dragons in  Daughter of the Moon Goddess  ;161
13w3z5vjma02yg;13w3z5v;jma02yg;suelynntan;31.05.2023 00:46;5.0;Thank you so much  I believe the books could be crossover  somewhere between older YA and Adult   especially with  Daughter of the Moon Goddess  and its themes of self discovery  first love  and family  Grief and the meaning of loss is explored in  Heart of the Sun Warrior   in addition to love  I believe my next full length novel to be similar  while the book after that   inspired by the legend of Lady White Snake   leans more toward Adult ;1470

13w3z5vjmbwsqp;13w3z5v;jmbwsqp;suelynntan;31.05.2023 12:34;3.0;Thank you   I m so happy you loved the books  These legends mean a lot to me as I grew up hearing about them too    The ending of  Heart of the Sun Warrior  was the hardest part of the book to write  I drafted the story after writing the first book  and while I had a sense of how I wanted it to end  a challenge was how to get there  The ending is the one I believe to be most true to the characters   which may not be who they started out as in  Daughter of the Moon Goddess   but who they ended up becoming after the events in the books  All that they went through on their own or together  the choices they made   would inevitably change them  both as individuals and their relationships with one another ;2159
13w3z5vjm9wcjo;13w3z5v;jm9wcjo;suelynntan;31.05.2023 00:18;5.0;Ahh thank you  It means a lot to me that you loved them  I drink a lot of tea while writing  My usual is a blend of jasmine and green tea  I also love ginger tea  Hong Kong milk tea  and bubble tea for the really hard drafting or editing times  Dark chocolate is my go to snack  85    but it sometimes scares me how fast the bars vanish when I m on deadline    It s hard to know when a book is really finished   I guess  when it goes into the  pass pages  stage of editing  when it becomes much harder to change anything in the manuscript given formatting and all  Usually around that time  I just feel a moment of terror that  this is it   I do love the feeling of typing  The End  after a draft though  and if I have the time  I d love to celebrate with more sleep    ;2403
13w3z5vjma1ggz;13w3z5v;jma1ggz;suelynntan;31.05.2023 00:56;4.0;Great question  I don t see myself as any of the characters   Xingyin is definitely a lot braver than me  I d have run away from the nine headed serpent  There are times I can emphathize more with what they are going through  if it s a trait or experience I ve shared in a different way  for example  heartbreak  fear  uncertainty or grief   But I tend to imagine them as individuals  both the heroes and villains  with their own stories and past that might have shaped who they are ;1528
13w3z5vjma31mw;13w3z5v;jma31mw;suelynntan;31.05.2023 01:08;7.0;Thank you for asking  This is one of my favorite stories since my childhood and I hope you ll find it interesting     Daughter of the Moon Goddess  was inspired by the legend of Chang e  one that is much loved and often retold during the Mid Autumn festival  According to the myth  long ago ten suns rose in the sky  causing great suffering to the mortals  A great archer named Houyi shot down nine of the suns  leaving one to light the world  The Emperor of Heaven gifted him with the elixir of immortality  but Houyi did not drink it  reluctant to leave his beloved wife Chang e  However  Chang e took the elixir and ascended to the skies as an immortal  where some believed the emperor banished her to the moon for her theft    There are several variations of the legend as to why Chang e took the elixir   whether to save it from thieves  or because Houyi became a tyrannical king  or perhaps she desired immortality  I felt it was a hard choice  and wondered what if there might be more behind her decision  It was then  I imagined the existence of her daughter  and the adventures she woudl embark upon as she fought for her mother s freedom ;1479
13w3z5vjmbat3a;13w3z5v;jmbat3a;suelynntan;31.05.2023 08:25;2.0;Thanks for the question  Drafting  Daughter of the Moon Goddess  was pretty intense  and it took several months  Back then  I wrote all the time  even while traveling  However  editing the story took much longer  I tend to edit quite agressively  often cutting or rewriting scenes or chapters that I feel need work ;1072
13w3z5vjma5gzn;13w3z5v;jma5gzn;suelynntan;31.05.2023 01:26;6.0;Thanks for asking this  It can be tricky and it s important to manage deadlines around publication time  The release of  Daughter of the Moon Goddess  was a little stressful as I was also working on  Heart of the Sun Warrior  then  that was scheduled for release later that year   As it was my debut novel  there was quite the learning curve as I didn t know what to expect    For the sequel  I had already drafted the story before most of the promotion took place  along with the ending   though the  how  of it  can sometimes be equally challenging  It s always important for me that the characters  actions and choices feel natural and authentic to who they are  and what they ve gone through ;1051

13vw7a8jm9fog4;13vw7a8;jm9fog4;ujelly_fish;30.05.2023 22:19;2.0;I think this is because The Goldfinch is her most recent and Pulitzer Prize winning novel  while The Secret History is her debut  and a foundational novel for the Dark Academia genre    The Little Friend is sort of a middle child    I haven t read any of the three  though I do want to  but that might explain it ;1490

13voyjgjm7q7jr;13voyjg;jm7q7jr;Ineffable7980x;30.05.2023 15:41;2.0;Hmm  and I found the understatement very reminiscent of Hemingway at his best   It reminded me a lot of The Sun Also Rises  except with different themes of course   The real intention is never directly stated   The characters always talk about other than what they really mean   I thought it was very skillfully done ;2386

13voitcjmi2lo5;13voitc;jmi2lo5;KimBrrr1975;1.06.2023 17:24;1.0;For me  there can be a pretty big difference between crime and thriller  They might be in the same book  or they might not  I have read a lot of true crime  and honestly real life is way worse than anything you ll read in fiction  If you don t like that type of anticipation  then they might not be the best genres for you  Within crime  you can read books like Mindhunter by John Douglas which is a true crime  told from the perspective of one of the first FBI profilers  It doesn t read like a novel where you are waiting for the result  you usually know it upfront and then learn how he went through the process of identifying the victim and offender  But  ti can be pretty gruesome so it might not be for you  For thrillers  like already mentioned it is the anticipation that I enjoy in reading them  The same reason why I like thriller and horror movies  Why  exactly  I don t know   As a kid I was terrified I d be a victim of a home invasion murder or something  and so scary movies helped me to come to terms with my irrational fear  But it s one of those things where if you know you won t enjoy it  then it s probably not worth your time  If you hate rollercoasters  why spend your time and money on a rollercoaster theme park  Kind of the same idea  There are a lot of options in genres that don t have to be thrillers that make you uncomfortable  I love memoirs  for example  because I love hearing people s stories  Even when the author is completely opposite of me  I appreciate their story and how they tell it ;2312

13vno09jm8umlz;13vno09;jm8umlz;kodran;30.05.2023 19:59;1.0;Yeah  Also stuff as journals might be like that  Thinking of Douglas s Last chance to see  It s been over 30 years I think  some of the species indeed are extinct now  but it doesn t take away from the anecdotes  the interesting facts about the efforts to keep them alive and so on ;1504
13vndppjm6smfx;13vndpp;jm6smfx;Zestyclose-Compote-4;30.05.2023 11:22;1717.0;My spouse is the one that reads  I m subbed to r books because I aspire to read more  I find it challenging ;904
13vndppjm6vghc;13vndpp;jm6vghc;BetterDay2733;30.05.2023 11:51;641.0;My husband doesn t enjoy reading as a hobby  He s a biologist and reads a lot of academic journal articles for work  So doing more reading when he has free time isn t his idea of fun ;2422
13vndppjm6x7va;13vndpp;jm6x7va;fitandstrong0926;30.05.2023 12:07;490.0;Another explanation might also include lack of time  I LOVE to read  but it s something you have to make time for  I haven t read consistently for many years  but I ve just picked it back up this year  I read only one book a month until April but in may I ve read 5 books  Every spare minute is dedicated to reading  which isn t something I really realized before  how time consuming it is  People with busy lives might not have time to read  even if it s something they enjoy ;744
13vndppjm70c2u;13vndpp;jm70c2u;goosey_goosen;30.05.2023 12:35;143.0;My spouse doesn t read  I wish he would  so I could share some of my favorite stories and worlds with him  or at least because misery loves company and sometimes the end of a good book destroys you  haha  But as it is he has his own hobbies and we get to do our solitary hobbies beside each other anyways  so he has to listen to my existential crises anyways;2355
13vndppjm6zjk7;13vndpp;jm6zjk7;aytayjay;30.05.2023 12:28;258.0;My partner isn t a book reader  There was a time I might have been judgy about that but now I m just happy that he doesn t resent the time I spend reading as time not spent with him  as a previous  voracious reader  ex of mine did    He s happy to let me blather on about books I ve read and we watch the film adaptations together so I can explain to him in detail why his favourite films are wrong   It s a fun wind up  nobody actually gets nitpicky or annoyed before anyone gets started    We each have our own hobbies which we can enjoy seeing the other enjoy while not participating   and for me that s reading    I absolutely agree that reading for fun   or not stems from childhood and if someone reaches adulthood without reading for leisure its extremely unlikely they re going to start  It has no bearing on intelligence ;1715
13vndppjm6x3db;13vndpp;jm6x3db;ok_chaos42;30.05.2023 12:06;84.0;Hubs is not a fan of reading  He prefers a more interactive hobby  He tries to read for me but I don t push  Instead I try to encourage the 7 year old to get into reading  She finally said she really liked reading at the end of the school year after struggling for a year and a half learning to read  She still has her hiccups with harder words but the fact that she likes it makes me so happy ;2407
13vndppjm7qkaz;13vndpp;jm7qkaz;Shot-Artichoke-4106;30.05.2023 15:44;36.0;Before I met my husband  I dated a guy who wasn t a reader  which was fine   however  one day I went to the bookstore and bought a couple of books and he said  I don t know why you waste your money on books when you could go to the movies instead    It was a wake up call for me   If he d said  spend  instead of  waste  and     when you could get them from the library instead   then it would have been fine   You know  be frugal in how you spend your money and all of that   But to say that spending money on books was a waste   especially when it was my money that didn t have anything to do with him    No   That was the moment I started to understand how different our values were and that this relationship wasn t going to be good long term   On the surface  it was about reading  but really  it was about a lot more than that ;574
13vndppjm71m7n;13vndpp;jm71m7n;albgshack;30.05.2023 12:45;54.0;Has anyone on here had an issue with their partner that doesn t read having a problem with you reading   My partner very much voices his aggravation when I read   He says in anti social   Do not communicate with him   All because I m reading   It s like he s jealous of my books   And this is my second partner who has been like this   My husband that passed away 10 yrs ago was the same way  He called my Kindle  Kendall  like it was a man ;2125
13vndppjm72cw0;13vndpp;jm72cw0;autumncandles;30.05.2023 12:52;11.0;My parents do not read and never have but I ve loved reading since I was a child and it s something I ve carried through my life  I don t think it has to be something encouraged by your family really  My partner doesn t read because its just not a hobby he s into  Hes very busy a lot with college as an engineering student and so he s reading and doing work a lot so when he has free time he doesn t want to read and he prefers to play video games as he finds it more fun and engaging;408
13vndppjm72l96;13vndpp;jm72l96;littleleppy;30.05.2023 12:53;12.0;My husband pours all his free time into gaming while for me it s reading  He doesn t mind listening to me ramble about books and I enjoy him rambling about games  Once in a blue moon he ll pick up a book and read it and I will read it too  We like the same kinds of stories regardless how it s told  book  game  movie  show  which is the important part to me  We are just kind of dividing and experiencing stories in mediums the other doesn t tackle and sharing that experience with each other ;1746
13vndppjm71b7f;13vndpp;jm71b7f;dinosaurholes;30.05.2023 12:43;30.0;I have an MA In literature  My I can t remember a time my husband has sat down and read a book  He reads slowly and has ADHD  He does read the news  and I ve seen him listen to audiobooks  but otherwise he just doesn t really care to read  He listens to me talk about them  and I have plenty of friends colleagues who do read  so it doesn t bother me at all ;2452
13vndppjm6vm5y;13vndpp;jm6vm5y;hocfutuis;30.05.2023 11:52;9.0;My late husband read as a young man   his son was even named for a book character   but he d lost the habit by the time I knew him for some reason ;1081
13vndppjm6ucpt;13vndpp;jm6ucpt;onceuponalilykiss;30.05.2023 11:40;66.0;My partner doesn t finish as many novels as I do because she s a lot busier  but she does read constantly  I ve tried dating people who don t read at all but we never really had anything in common  it s an interest that kind of tints your other interests  if that makes sense   We don t necessarily even read the same books  though  We have some overlap but our tastes differ overall  It s not really that important to be identical to your partner  after all  and would actually kind of make the relationship worse if you were    That said  what is and is not an  avid  reader is so subjective  To some people  6 books by June is basically not reading  while to others 2 novels a year is avid still ;1295
13vndppjm6vqre;13vndpp;jm6vqre;wordyshipmate82;30.05.2023 11:54;51.0;When I met my wife  she read  and we read together  it was wonderful   Over the years  she rarely reads anymore  although she does love to read her plant books    Occasionally  I will get her to read something I m really into  she read Native Son last summer and loved it  but mostly  I am totally out here on my own   To quote Vonnegut   So it goes  ;1867
13vndppjm6v04h;13vndpp;jm6v04h;lyn73;30.05.2023 11:46;9.0;I wouldn t call myself a  reader  but recently  a change came to my life where I had a lot of free time   so I began to read   I now read about 2 3 books a week   I think I wasn t reading before because of lack of time and interest   COVID was hard    you couldn t visit the library inside and I like to look at books get a general idea of the content before checking them out     My husband does not read books for pleasure   I think it s very hard to read when you are not motivated to do so   We have several streaming services   so he relaxes by watching something as I suppose most non readers do   Life is challenging    so I can t blame those who take that route     Bottom line is I think for most people  the circumstances must be just right in order to motivate someone to read for pleasure ;2119
13vndppjm6xgq5;13vndpp;jm6xgq5;crowstgeorge;30.05.2023 12:10;21.0;This was my husband until he joined my audible account  Now he digests more books than I do  It s been very fun for our marriage  I actually get to trade books with my partner ;1410
13vndppjm71d2r;13vndpp;jm71d2r;whalvo;30.05.2023 12:43;9.0;I love reading and I can t fall asleep at night without reading at least a few pages  I think I can count the number of books my husband has read since we married on one hand and we re going on 19 years  That being said  he s a very smart man and stimulates his mind with projects and busywork  Just not big into books ;2347
13vndppjm6v52b;13vndpp;jm6v52b;lilycurrant;30.05.2023 11:48;6.0;He would if he didn t fall asleep after a page  I live to read but  struggle finding time;57
13vndppjm72dv3;13vndpp;jm72dv3;monsterosaleviosa;30.05.2023 12:52;6.0;I don t see such a solid line between readers and non readers  I d say my husband is kind of a reader  in that he values reading and wishes it were something he had more drive to do lately  But he s probably only read a handful of books in the past five years  and most of those were related to games or shows and such  That said  he does have a healthy mix of hobbies  He spends plenty of time watching Wondrium lectures  learning a language  deep diving into new topics  etc   so he s often doing intellectual things that just aren t sitting down to read a book    So I think maybe a better answer from me is that I couldn t maintain a relationship with someone who wasn t into generally intellectual pursuits  It doesn t have to be all they do  of course   I spend tons of time watching Real Housewives and playing farming sims  But I just don t think I d vibe with someone who wasn t driven by learning things ;729
13vndppjm785rq;13vndpp;jm785rq;SagePine;30.05.2023 13:37;5.0;I am a voracious reader  while my husband of 27 years has only read one book since we ve been married  I was sure my children would be readers since I showered them with books while growing up  but they  too  are not interested in reading      The thing that bothers me the most about my husband not being a reader is that he doesn t see the value in my books that I hold for them  I have a few bookshelves that hold my favorites  and he keeps saying I should give them away or put them in the shed so we would have more room for  other stuff   I would never think to tell him he has too many tools in his garage and he should get rid of half of them      I also don t meet many people who read anymore  I have one friend who reads  It makes me sad to think what people are missing out on ;357
13vndppjm7hz4z;13vndpp;jm7hz4z;lyan-cat;30.05.2023 14:47;5.0;I am the reader  My husband read only rarely for pleasure when we met  He reads even less now  mostly because as he has aged his sight has gotten prohibitive  Having just the one eye always effected his reading  but now it s not focusing as well as it used to  either    He plays a ton of chess  He s always current on any space related news or events  He does read articles online if they fall into his areas of interest  Other than that  he can t be bothered    I don t look down on non readers  I used to get shit regularly for always having my nose in a book  why would I do that to anyone else  I know how I feel if I have to watch any kind of sport and I assume the gnawing boredom is similar for a non reader    I get excited for people who find a writer or genre when they thought they weren t  book people   and I like talking about books  but it s not my whole personality  There s tons of other stuff to chat about ;881
13vndppjm7185t;13vndpp;jm7185t;floridianreader;30.05.2023 12:42;49.0;My ex husband didn t read at all and was actually jealous of books  He complained a lot early in our relationship that I was spending too much time reading and  not with him   I stopped reading almost entirely during our marriage for him and lost a lot of valuable time reading and missed out on so many great books  I m still finding books that I missed hearing about or seeing in a bookstore bc of him  I traded him in for a husband who not only reads but supports my habit and is not the least bit jealous of a book ;477
13vndppjm6yuz0;13vndpp;jm6yuz0;Pimp_Daddy_Patty;30.05.2023 12:22;19.0;Moral of the story  It s okay to have a partner who doesn t have the same interests as you ;67

13vndppjm78eoo;13vndpp;jm78eoo;Critical-Lobster5828;30.05.2023 13:39;16.0;Hmm  I don t know how to break it to you but that s not entirely true  My parents didn t read and neither did I throughout my adolescent life  I met my boyfriend four years ago at 27 and he s a big reader  I started reading through our relationship to nurture that interest as something we could connect over because it was so important to him    I ended up going back to school after 2 years of this and am now in my last year of an English Honours degree because of how much it s grown on me  It s now my favourite hobby and we have  book club  together where he will read a book with me that I have to read for class so we can discuss it afterwards    Not to say that all people can do what I did  because I had the means and opportunity to read with my boyfriend  But picking up new hobbies isn t primarily based on what you did growing up  Reading is my favourite hobby  and maybe career  that never existed before I met my boyfriend   ;799
13vndppjm6yd6h;13vndpp;jm6yd6h;duckingtonn;30.05.2023 12:17;5.0;Not necessarily partners because  uhm  what partners  However  I find that not that many people read around me and I would really like them to read  it is so fascinating and takes you to another world ;809
13vndppjm714et;13vndpp;jm714et;Svenroy;30.05.2023 12:41;4.0;My spouse is not a reader  he s like your wife and maybe pulls in a book a year  and that s only if something  really  interests him  He s super smart  and definitely has the time so I think overall it s just not a draw for him like it is for me for whatever reason  The only issue I really have with it is that he insists that he loves reading and gets offended if I ever mention or talk about the fact that he s not really into reading  I think he used to a lot more as a kid  but thats clearly not the case lol  Plus I just wish I could talk to him about books more in general  I d love his input on certain books or even to just have someone to bounce my thoughts off of about what I m reading;14
13vndppjm78p7y;13vndpp;jm78p7y;BadFishCM;30.05.2023 13:42;5.0;I m the reader in my relationship  but it seems opposite of what you have theorized    My wife had a healthy familial relationship with her parents and was encouraged to read  she read a ton when she was younger  but now she struggles to read 2 books a year    One of my parents actively made fun of me for reading  while the other was just neutral about it and I m on book 10 in 2023  I assume my love for books came from some form of escapism  Life has had a positive turn in the past decade  but I still have a passion for reading  If not more so now ;548
13vndppjm7cggo;13vndpp;jm7cggo;KatJen76;30.05.2023 14:09;3.0;My husband is interesting  If you ask him whether or not he reads  he ll say no  But he does  Obsessively  Reading fanfic on AO3 is one of his main activities  It s his off switch  at the end of a workday or while he s waiting for dinner to cook  or winding down for the night  that s what he s doing  I m not sure why actual books intimidate him so much  He will read from time to time  It s very much a childhood thing with him  His parents were not readers  and growing up  he struggled with school  so I think he has negative associations    I don t think it s necessarily bad when people don t read  It s when they don t substitute it with an activity of value that I think it s detrimental  Someone who doesn t read because they d rather garden or ice skate or fix up the old cars they love  OK  Someone who just watches TV while scrolling social media  not so great  And it s uncomfortable when they re proud of not reading  Very anti intellectual and defensive  Like  rather than be honest and say I don t value this  I m going to put you down so you don t think you re better than me  ;1698

13vndppjm7yjgb;13vndpp;jm7yjgb;Odd-Transition-5032;30.05.2023 16:35;5.0;My husband generally doesn t read   He s intelligent  a critical thinker  interested in learning  etc   For me  reading is my expression of those things  but that s simply not the case for him   Occasionally I m disappointed about the fact he doesn t read  but I understand   He had a rough childhood   In and out of school   He CAN read  like he s not illiterate  but I ve heard him read aloud and it s labored   It s not fluent like it is for me   So I get it   I think it makes such a difference  your experience in childhood   Do people around you read   Do they read to you   Do they encourage you to read   And is your education interrupted or consistent good ;1445

13vndppjm8jmkc;13vndpp;jm8jmkc;RetiredGamer05;30.05.2023 18:48;5.0;I think a huge part of it is childhood upbringing  My partner was an immigrant family in America with a younger sibling when she was 10yo  So with her having to babysit after school  learning English as a second language and immediately working when she turned 16  she didn t have the time to read  while her sister being born in the US  went through North American education  parents were in a better situation financially by the time she grew up meant she didn t have to work immediately and without the load of a younger sibling  she developed a reading habit     I on the other hand was a very sick child growing up and with a mom who would never let me watch TV or play video games  I had to read books while bedridden  sick  to pass the time and not be bored  Hence  it s easier for me to read in my spare time  I also came to North America for college  which meant that I didn t have to work growing up  parents made medium income back home and things are more affordable which meant we didn t struggle as much  ;1157

13vndppjm6ygda;13vndpp;jm6ygda;janarrino;30.05.2023 12:18;5.0;hmm I think that would make sense since music and film tv shows are much more widespread as entertainment  if someone does not read  and is not interested in books it s hard to be aware of the  book world   to know various authors etc  although genres are not hard to grasp and they could ask at least to be polite and show interest   ;2158

13vndppjm7nwug;13vndpp;jm7nwug;little_chupacabra89;30.05.2023 15:26;0.0;Lmao so true  It s because much of our idea of reading is intertwined with knowledge based and intelligence level  And that opens an entirely different can of worms  like  what does it mean to be intelligent  What s the difference between intelligence and ignorance  and why is it okay to judge people based on their level of intelligence or their depth of knowledge anyway  These days  we seem to make allowances for just about anyone with regards to anything about them and their identity  except intellectual ability ;969

13vndppjm9k411;13vndpp;jm9k411;Droidlivesmatter;30.05.2023 22:49;10.0;Hook him on good stories to read    Worst thing I ve seen when I was working at a bookstore was when boys get older   they stop reading in their teenage years   If you get him hooked at a young age  and then he wavers in his teen years  Don t make him jump into adult fantasy or adult books  they might bore him  If he reads it and says it s not for him  try out comics     I ve had so many parents get angry about me recommending comics and  They should read a real book  only for the kids to rekindle their love of reading and wanting to read comics more than TV    then eventually  the hope is they pick up adult books as they age ;1346
13vndppjmad173;13vndpp;jmad173;Alaira314;31.05.2023 02:25;2.0;I ve found that I need to form at least some opinion on the current TV and movie situation in order to meet the minimum office smalltalk participation requirement  especially since moving locations somewhere that people watch rather than reading playing  I have my own issues with this because I don t like to watch media  but it s one of those necessary timesinks if I don t want to screw myself over professionally  If someone actually  likes  this kind of media  they d want to do more than I do pilots  reading plot summaries  watching summary videos  checking memes  etc  and I can see that being a massive timesink   I can only imagine the hell I would ve gone through if I was dealing with this in the 90s 00s  when we were expected to watch things as they aired  I typically break up an hour long show into 2  sessions on separate days yes  a movie takes 4 5 sessions   I ve given up on movies  as far as office talk goes   No way could I be ready to discuss last night s episode of the Sopranos the day after it aired ;2441

13vndppjm71abd;13vndpp;jm71abd;notebookhunter;30.05.2023 12:43;4.0;in some sense  you re right of course  this is true    but exactly as you pointed out in your post  reading for leisure is a hobby  you get a very different experience from it imo  for example  you almost always read fiction or novels from cover to cover  but rarely do you read reference books from cover to cover in one go  i feel like the sort of focus  attention span different kinds of books demand is also very different  i mean qualitatively  so I guess this is what I mean when it feels like it doesn t  count   in some way  my fiction reading attention span is shot whereas my technical reading attention is fine ;2268

13vndppjm7frby;13vndpp;jm7frby;neur0piquant1520;30.05.2023 14:32;15.0;I had to teach myself how to listen to audiobooks  When I first started I sat doing nothing and got distracted by my own brain wandering off  The thing that clicked for me was when I worked as a home health aide and one of my assignments was a very old man who was pretty independent  He used it as a way to have someone in his house but also to help with cleaning the house and laundry  After a while music was boring soni ventured to give audiobooks another try  It worked finally because I had a routine down and relied on muscle memory    We all have different brains  My body needs to be stimulated just enough for my mind to focus ;1761
13vndppjm7gsw5;13vndpp;jm7gsw5;Stephen_King_19;30.05.2023 14:39;50.0;I didn t start doing audiobooks until I had kids  and realized I did not have free time to really get sucked into a book anymore   It s been a while  but I believe I had to sort of  train  my brain for it   I started with books I d read before  and remembered enough of the story that if I did space out  it was not a big deal  and I had an idea of how far to back up in the story     For me  I need to be doing a task that I can do on autopilot  like folding laundry  vacuuming  washing dishes  certain crafting activities   Driving tends to work well for me  too   On the flip side  there are MANY activities I cannot combine audiobooks or podcasts with   Grocery shopping and trying to listen is generally a futile effort with me  as I m often comparing prices  trying to find something specific  it just takes more of my brain s bandwidth   All that said  there are certainly books I ve given up on  that I might try at another time  or if it ever gets another narrator that clicks well with me     Good luck in your literary journey ;674
13vndppjm7yes0;13vndpp;jm7yes0;Gaardc;30.05.2023 16:34;10.0;I have to say I get this but It s definitely context depending  Sometimes I m driving and can t stand music and an audiobook is perfect  sometimes I m driving and I realized I haven t heard a word they said and I switch to music  Sometimes neither works for me  Gotta adapt lol ;2240
13vndppjm8585e;13vndpp;jm8585e;tenders11;30.05.2023 17:17;5.0;I can only do it when I m doing things that require minimal  thought   not to be confused with attention   I can listen to a book while paying attention to the road on a commute I do every day because that drive doesn t require an internal monologue  I can do it and be aware of everything going on around me without actively thinking about it  The more of a muscle memory activity it is  the easier it is to follow the book ;68

13vndppjm6v5pw;13vndpp;jm6v5pw;Bomb_Diggity;30.05.2023 11:48;-5.0;I m the same way  I hate reading books and always have  I really don t feel like I m missing out on anything either  Anybody who reads in their free time and feels intellectually superior to those who don t are just in their ego and showing their insecurity  In fact  I feel like some are motivated to read purely or partially by the desire to feel superior to others and not because they actually enjoy it   Don t get me wrong  I think reading is a great hobby to have  However  I don t feel it is required in order to be a smart educated person ;327

13vndppjm9dhtl;13vndpp;jm9dhtl;AccomplishedPear5;30.05.2023 22:04;2.0;I LOVE scribd  Its  12 month for unlimited listening  They  will  start limiting your selection to older public domain audiobooks after your third or fourth audiobook in a month  but thats more than I can listen to before the month resets anyway   It also gives you access to hundreds of thousands of ebooks  documents  including sheet music   and magazines and includes a complementary subscription to TuneIn Radio   I think its an incredible value   Edit  If your library has Libby Id highly recommend that as well ;2438
13vndppjm96fkr;13vndpp;jm96fkr;kwistaf;30.05.2023 21:16;2.0;Yeah I m less than 30 pages in and it s already spooky  If you like the kinda dark  very specific vibe sort of books  have you checked out The Road ;2174

13vndppjm7f88v;13vndpp;jm7f88v;You_Stupes;30.05.2023 14:28;1.0; 1 for this recommendation  People like to talk shit about it  and sure there are plot holes and of course you could say the world is HEAVILY inspired by themes in LOTR  but this will hands down remain my favorite fantasy YA series of all time ;648

13vfkoijm5wki4;13vfkoi;jm5wki4;20above;30.05.2023 04:38;13.0;I think its a bit of both probably  Alot of light novels get their start as serialized web novels and their main audience tend to be teens so they are comparable to YA in a sense  I m sure there are also translation challenges as writing rules are also different  such as how many light novels don t always indicate who is talking  and translators have to account for that  Also the people that are translating it into English aren t necessarily writers themselves to polish things up a bit  Its definitely not a genre to go into expecting high quality  I think the best I ve seen so far is Tearmoon Empire  But overall I can still enjoy the stories though it can be a bit of a whiplash feeling when switching between a western book and a light novel ;1732

to   search inquire to grope   an outlet from this   cloud of doubt    and find the   open day of certainty            Notice she does not have faith  and speaks of the will of Heaven  not the will of God  which is clear in the scriptures        She helps redeem Edward         Jane  you think me  I daresay  an irreligious dog  but my heart swells with gratitude to the   beneficent God of      this earth            2 Corinthians 4 4    King James Version    4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not  lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ  who is the image of God  should shine unto them         jHe sees not as man sees  but far clearer  judges not as man judges  but far more wisely  I did wrong  I would have sullied my innocent flower breathed guilt on its purity  the Omnipotent snatched it from me  I  in my stiff necked rebellion  almost cursed the dispensation  instead of bending to the decree  I defied it  Divine justice pursued its course  disasters came thick on me  I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow of death  His chastisements are mighty  and one smote me which has humbled me for ever  You know I was proud of my strength  but what is it now  when I must give it over to foreign guidance  as a child does its weakness  Of late  Jane only only of late   I began to see and acknowledge the hand of God in my doom    I began to experience remorse  repentance  the wish for reconcilement to my Maker  I began sometimes to pray    very brief prayers they were    but very sincere          I thank my Maker  that  in the midst of judgment  he has remembered mercy  I humbly entreat    my Redeemer    to give me strength to lead henceforth a    purer life    than I have done hitherto          Note  he speaks of brief remorse  but then give himself over to his Redeemer  who has given him purer life   this is theological  he is giving himself over to the God of this Earth  it s somewhat Gnostic  this is a different God than the Christian God        And the book doesn t end with Jane and Edward  It doesn t end with Jane  even  It ends with        As to St  John Rivers  he left England  he went to India  He entered on the path he had marked for himself  he pursues it still  A more resolute  indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers  Firm  faithful  and devoted  full of energy  and zeal  and truth  he labours for his race  he clears their painful way to improvement  he hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it  He may be stern  he may be exacting  he may be ambitious yet  but his is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart    who guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon           Just to note this is another Pilgrim s Progress reference  there are many MANY references to this work  you cannot consider this book s meaning without proper context         His is the exaction of the apostle  who speaks but for Christ  when he says  Whosoever will come after me  let him deny himself  and take up his cross and follow me   His is the ambition of the   high master spirit     see Gnosticism         which aims to   fill a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth     FILL A PLACE IN THE FIRST RANK this is GNOSTIC        who stand without fault before the throne of God  who share the last mighty victories of the Lamb  who are called  and chosen  and faithful         St  John is unmarried  he never will marry now  Himself has hitherto sufficed to the toil  and the toil draws near its close  his glorious sun hastens to its setting  The last letter I received from him drew from my eyes human tears  and yet filled my heart with divine joy  he anticipated his sure reward  his incorruptible crown  I know that a stranger s hand will write to me next  to say that the good and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy of his Lord  And why weep for this  No fear of death will darken St  John s last hour  his mind will be unclouded  his heart will be undaunted  his hope will be sure  his faith steadfast  His own words are a pledge of this          My Master   he says   has forewarned me  Daily He announces more distinctly   Surely I come quickly   and hourly I more eagerly respond         This is cryptic  but St  John represents the Pilgrim who has given up everything for the promise of the next life  he is walking the  narrow path  and he will not fear death  which is basically Jane s struggle through the entire book  a struggle to deal with fear of mortality        Now the last line           Amen  even so come  Lord Jesus           Amen   I believe   even so come    Lord Jesus        She speaks of Jesus coming  not her coming to him  but him coming to her  this to me speaks of Revelation         I point to all of this to point out how cleverly crafted this books is worded  as to on the surface appear as though she is Christian  which was very much neccesary at the time  but if you look at the larger narrative and place this in the context of the larger story  her path toward Gnostic theology or self worship  or the idea of usurping god  luciferian doctrine it all makes MUCH MORE SENSE;197

and savage tribes hold that doctrine  but Christians and civilised nations disown it     How  I don t understand     It is not violence that best overcomes hate nor vengeance that most certainly heals injury     What then     Read the New Testament  and observe what Christ says  and how He acts  make His word your rule  and His conduct your example     What does He say     Love your enemies  bless them that curse you  do good to them that hate you and despitefully use you     Then I should love Mrs  Reed  which I cannot do  I should bless her son John  which is impossible                            Well did I remember Mrs  Reed s face  and I eagerly sought the familiar image  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion  I had left this woman in bitterness and hate  and I came back to her now with no other emotion than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings  and a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries to be reconciled and clasp hands in amity     Love me  then  or hate me  as you will   I said at last   you have my full and free forgiveness  ask now for God s  and be at peace                           Not a moment could be lost  the very sheets were kindling  I rushed to his basin and ewer  fortunately  one was wide and the other deep  and both were filled with water  I heaved them up  deluged the bed and its occupant  flew back to my own room  brought my own water jug  baptized the couch afresh  and  by God s aid  succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it    Yet after all my task was not an easy one  often I would rather have pleased than teased him  My future husband was becoming to me my whole world  and more than the world  almost my hope of heaven  He stood between me and every thought of religion  as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun  I could not  in those days  see God for His creature  of whom I had made an idol     My eyes were covered and closed  eddying darkness seemed to swim round me  and reflection came in as black and confused a flow  Self abandoned  relaxed  and effortless  I seemed to have laid me down in the dried up bed of a great river  I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains  and felt the torrent come  to rise I had no will  to flee I had no strength  I lay faint  longing to be dead  One idea only still throbbed life like within me a remembrance of God  it begot an unuttered prayer  these words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind  as something that should be whispered  but no energy was found to express them  Be not far from me  for trouble is near  there is none to help       Still indomitable was the reply  I care for myself  The more solitary  the more friendless  the more unsustained I am  the more I will respect myself  I will keep the law given by God  sanctioned by man     Do as I do  trust in God and yourself  Believe in heaven  Hope to meet again there     I had already gained the door  but  reader  I walked back walked back as determinedly as I had retreated  I knelt down by him  I turned his face from the cushion to me  I kissed his cheek  I smoothed his hair with my hand    God bless you  my dear master   I said   God keep you from harm and wrong direct you  solace you reward you well for your past kindness to me      In the midst of my pain of heart and frantic effort of principle  I abhorred myself  I had no solace from self approbation  none even from self respect  I had injured wounded left my master  I was hateful in my own eyes  Still I could not turn  nor retrace one step  God must have led me on   Worn out with this torture of thought  I rose to my knees  Night was come  and her planets were risen  a safe  still night  too serene for the companionship of fear  We know that God is everywhere  but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us  and it is in the unclouded night sky  where His worlds wheel their silent course  that we read clearest His infinitude  His omnipotence  His omnipresence  I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr  Rochester  Looking up  I  with tear dimmed eyes  saw the mighty Milky way  Remembering what it was what countless systems there swept space like a soft trace of light I felt the might and strength of God  Sure was I of His efficiency to save what He had made  convinced I grew that neither earth should perish  nor one of the souls it treasured  I turned my prayer to thanksgiving  the Source of Life was also the Saviour of spirits  Mr  Rochester was safe  he was God s  and by God would he be guarded  I again nestled to the breast of the hill  and ere long in sleep forgot sorrow     I can but die   I said   and I believe in God  Let me try to wait His will in silence     Ere long  with the servant s aid  I contrived to mount a staircase  my dripping clothes were removed  soon a warm  dry bed received me  I thanked God experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful joy and slept     I was sure St  John Rivers pure lived  conscientious  zealous as he was had not yet found that peace of God which passeth all understanding  he had no more found it  I thought  than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost elysium regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring  but which possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly    Yes  I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law  and scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment  God directed me to a correct choice  I thank His providence for the guidance     I wonder at the goodness of God  the generosity of my friends  the bounty of my lot  I do not repine      God will protect you  for you have undertaken His work   I answered     Oh  I will give my heart to God   I said   You do not want it  ;2293

13vfb6mjm5uet3;13vfb6m;jm5uet3;no-click-zone;30.05.2023 04:16;2.0;The critic Darko Suvin famously defined science fiction as the literature of  cognitive estrangement   He goes on to say    SF is  then  a literary genre whose necessary and sufficient conditions are the presence and interaction of estrangement and cognition  and whose main formal device is an imaginative framework alternative to the author s empirical environment   So what does all that mean  Let s take it in parts    Estrangement    Estrangement takes the world that we live in and makes it different or unfamiliar to us by exaggeration  transformation  extension and so on  According to Suvin   both SF and fantasy are literatures of estrangement   This is probably where your confusion comes from  An Orc and an Alien are both grotesque versions of the human  They are both alternatives that gain their imaginative power from the way that we compare and contrast them to the humans we know  Similarly a magic wand and a ray gun are technologies that depend for their fascination on the ways they are  and aren t  like the technologies we already have   BUT   Cognitive    This is where Suvin sees the difference  The estrangement produced by fantasy operates according to the logic of history  myth  magic  We accept the existence of orcs or faeries because there are mythological precedents for them  Magical happenings follow the logics of similarity  contagion  and the power of the word  According to Suvin  the world of fantasy is a  closed collateral world  where wish fulfillment is  an end sufficient to itself and cut off from the real contingencies   A magic carpet flies because we want it to  it s interesting to imagine something impossible and fanciful  it looks like it might fly  we ve heard stories about carpets flying but not because  there s some possible world in which carpets could fly   Fantasy is therefore not  cognitive   You don t have to think about how or why magic could work  It can t work  We know that  And even an elaborate magical system is totally self contained  It does not have to take into account physics  conservation of energy or mass      SF on the other hand is  cognitive  because it explores where the conditions of our universe as we understand them might lead if the conditions were extended or distorted or replaced  It doesn t take place in a collateral universe  It takes place in our universe  if our universe were different      Where the myth claims to explain once and for all the existence of a phenomena  SF posits them first as problems and then sees where they lead     Cognition   does not imply only a reflecting  of  reality  but a reflecting  on  reality  It implies a creative approach tending toward a dynamic transformation rather than towards a static mirroring  of the author s world   Fantasy worlds are like our worlds  only different  SF worlds  are  our world  only different    There s been a lot of writing after Suvin about this subject and plenty of people disagree with him  but his remains the standard  foundational definition of the difference  Hope that helps a little ;1105
13vfb6mjm5xmsf;13vfb6m;jm5xmsf;20above;30.05.2023 04:49;3.0;I just look at scifi as science y stuff  space  and technology where things are explained away using scientific concepts  even if its fake  Its not necessarily about it being realistic  It can be grounded like The Martian  it can be technological like Jurassic Park or The Terminator or it can be a big massive space war like Star Wars  Of course some stuff can change genres simply by changing one element  Think time travel for instance  Back to the Future would be sci fi while Outlander would be more fantasy simply because the former uses technology for time travel while the latter uses magic to fuel time travel  Sometimes its just easier to use the term  speculative fiction  as an umbrella term because so much can overlap with each other ;2272

13vfb6mjm66eao;13vfb6m;jm66eao;thedeadanddreaming23;30.05.2023 06:30;1.0;I ve always viewed science fiction as an extrapolation of reality  it can be as grounded or as out there as you want  but it has to stem from reality as we know it  Fantasy on the other hand  at least from what I ve read  which isn t much tbf    doesn t seem to concern itself with that  They have internally consisten logic and may even have a setting that resembles our reality  but it doesn t try and bridge that gap or explain how our reality can become that reality   That s just my observations though  and the line between the two genres can get blurry at times ;1325

13v9pw9jm6zfc3;13v9pw9;jm6zfc3;s7nclair;30.05.2023 12:27;3.0;I m interested in knowing what kind of translated literature you re reading  where the translation of names is your biggest concern and also seems plausible   Take any Russian literature for example  that s heavily set in historical and cultural context that surrounds mostly the setting of 1800 s Russia  If you insist on changing the name Ivan to John  would it really make sense for a John  or several other Richard s and Stevenson s to use the kopeck  a type of Russian currency  and ride the troika  a type of Russian horse drawn carriage  and be complete natives to the Russian system and culture of the 1800 s   I hope you see where I m getting at  Because in this case  it s not just names  there s absolutely nothing that translates well into English or its associated culture   Now you can t possibly just keep  translating  every single thing from geographical locations like the Nevsky Prospekt  Neva s Avenue  to the kopeck  a money equivalent to one hundredth of a rouble   After all  you wouldn t even know what book you re reading  It would be like reading something else entirely   That s why professional editors and translators choose to keep the culturally important words in as it was in the original text  while providing annotations that clarify the meaning   And I don t mean for this last part to come off as rude  but the people I know  and I m the same  who read translated literature  are accepting of the fact that they re reading works belonging to a different culture and geographical setting entirely  They enjoy taking the challenge of translating  researching and understanding the context  including names  as it was  instead of expecting to read an Americanised version of  say  War and Peace  John Smith being an illegitimate son of a  Russian  Aristrocrat  who s  in turn  named something like    Michael  I mean  surely  by now you see why it s a ridiculous proposition ;2071

13v9pw9jm5efq7;13v9pw9;jm5efq7;Mr_Skecchi;30.05.2023 02:07;-2.0;i think if a name has an intended meaning or desired effect for its audience it should be translated might be a better way to state my opinion  It might just be that my preferred genres of fantasy sci fi tend to have much more name meanings  so this is just a thing i encounter more   Lets take a name of a character from a book i am reading right now  expeditionary force series   a robot character is named skippy in a semi sarcastic way  There is no direct similarity to skippy as a name that would work with the jokes translated as is  but there is the cultural equivalent to the name  sunshine  that works with all the jokes  Its a different name  but carries similarly enough meaning that now the jokes dont seem like random unintelligible bullshit if you translate it   without it being translated  the at least 5 jokes per book about the characters name dont work and just seem stupid if you translate it  The author puts effort into structuring the jokes to make characters seem clever  if you dont translate the name but do try to adjust the words so the joke still works  it is basically up to the humor of the translator to be funny  therefore doing more damage to author intent and what the author picked than if you change the name to something similar  Other characters in the book whos names are just names can be left as is  but the aliens over the course of the books they give ironic names to because human mouths cant pronounce their names have meanings  therefore should be translated  This maintains author intent again better than a direct translation of a thing a non English speaker will not understand  as the author intends to demonstrate the scrappy unprofessional lack of respect for superior aliens species our protagonists are displaying  The author didnt pick those names out of some moral philosophy or personal attachment to the names  it is intended to be convey something and if you dont convey it then you are a shit translator ;354
13v9pw9jm5fh10;13v9pw9;jm5fh10;math-is-magic;30.05.2023 02:14;7.0;Yeah this is a huge issue with anime manga for example  Yu gi oh perhaps most famously renamed a bunch of characters  like Joey  Good luck diving into that fandom when half the people use the americanized name and half use the original japanese name ;308
13v9pw9jm6h3er;13v9pw9;jm6h3er;bofh000;30.05.2023 08:56;4.0;This 100    If I m reading a book by any author from any country culture most of the time the context culture is very relevant to the story and to my experience as a reader  And the names are a key part of that    Personally I have a rather bad opinion and I judge the quality of a book in the lower ranks if it s written in a different language from English  occurring in a non English speaking country  but all or most characters have English names or nicknames   all Bobby  Nicky  Max  Sam    obviously this isn t about books where the anglicized nicknames have a sensible justification   like they are about youth culture etc        I do agree that some names mean certain things  but that s what footnotes are for ;872
13v9pw9jm5khyk;13v9pw9;jm5khyk;Mr_Skecchi;30.05.2023 02:49;2.0;I am just a super slow learner with reading and writing  I cant write and can barely read in my native tongue  I think because i learned so late in life its just unnatural for me  And yeah it is annoying to be missing the original meaning  Thats my whole point  drives me crazy to  So we should do our best to capture the og meaning  The culture of the setting will be better conveyed by the cultural conventions the author assumes of the reader that arent written about anywhere i think  Most often in my experience  with what people are wearing what the author assumes is weird clothing type stuff  or food opinions and what not   So i dont feel like what you loose with the names hurts the overall cultural experience relative to what you loose from missing the original meaning intent behind it ;785

13v9pw9jm7eg51;13v9pw9;jm7eg51;Mr_Skecchi;30.05.2023 14:23;1.0;1  is my point  you can translate puns and intended effect a lot of the time  There isnt an equivalent for the red donkey thing in arabic to english  But calling someone a donkey in the first place has a completely different meaning in arabic than it does english in the first place  and the usage of red can be for saying someones over the top or  extra  as the youths put it  A pun incorporating those elements would make no sense in any english translation  But if you called them  douchenheimer  it both sounds namish  and conveys the intended effect of the original pun  You miss out on the wordplay of the pun but you gain what the author was trying to convey  2  if a name is an indicator of ethnic origin  than thats an intended purpose and relevant story information of the name  It would contradict what i am asking for if you translate it there  But names often arent indicators of ethnic origin in fiction  the majority of fiction i read isnt set on earth doesnt have any relation to earth cultures  3  if its not legibly translated  its a poor translation  there will always be poor translation  but that doesnt mean we shouldnt try  I dont know anything about chinese so i dont know what the origional words there are  or what specifically you are referring to in the legibility problem there  but i do completely understand  As youve no doubt seen yourself  tons of things dont have good translation meaning between languages  Most notably adjectives i find  every time ive ever seen a translation of the word  love  into english from arabic  its always been a bit off and weird  because there isnt a 1 to 1 what the arabic word is describing  if a closer direct translation is ever done it comes of to english readers as if the character is being proper and gentlemanly when they are using street slang and being noncommittal in the arabic version   habibe  always gets translated as  my love  when a more correct translation would be bae in my opinion  unless a guys saying it to another guy in which case a better translation would be my dude  The commitment level type of affection can completely change based on context and who youre saying it to  But poor translators have guy friends calling each other  my love  all the time  Author intent is poorly communicated with that bad translation  but it is still better than not communicating what the author tried to show at all and just writing the word  habibe  in the translation  Thats just literally the  all acording to keikaku  meme  If you directly translated an english speaker calling their S O baby to arabic  it would come off as super weird  Nothing goes smoothly between languages  whats important is communication what the author intended i think  If the author intended to communicate the cultural origin of the character  thats what should be communicated to the reader by using the cultural name  If they intended to communicate that this guys parents literally named him mistake  i think thats what should be communicated by the translator ;987
13v9pw9jm5gzai;13v9pw9;jm5gzai;Mr_Skecchi;30.05.2023 02:24;0.0;thats literally what people do  I am named after an angel that exists in islam and christianity and is pronounced differently in english and arabic  I get called the same angel  but pronounced entirely differently  I have never once been offended  I have never met anyone other than an american who would be offended by that  as i know several others who have done the same thing  Its literally only dumbass americans being offended on our behalf and then being cringe as fuck by trying to pronounce it in arabic and murdering it ;1055
13v9pw9jm78lur;13v9pw9;jm78lur;Mr_Skecchi;30.05.2023 13:41;1.0;sci fi books  i almost exclusively read sci fi books with some occasional fantasy  like 20  of the time the alien names are specifically to imply features behaviors of the aliens  Ships planets locations 95  of the time have names that have specific reference in both sci fi and fantasy  You see dumb shit like  dungeon of the the damned ones who vanished  translated directly as the turkish words written in english rather than translating that as it should be  I decided to post this now because i realized ive only read 1 translated series in the past couple years  and it was one with latin names in the source and remembered it was because so much stuff doesnt get translated  The specific last instance i saw this in was about a turkish fantasy book about snake people that had some name that meant something not being translated  this was a couple years ago but i can probably go back and find it  like 95  chance it was a fanslation as proper translations of arabic and turksih works into english are pretty rare  and i specifically dropped it for poor translation quality because not bothering to translate the name was a red flag for me  and saying the names should be translated in the comments on the fanslations always got me flamed so i knew it was a spicy opinion to most for some reason is why i decided to post it here   I didnt ask for everything to be translated  there are times when it doesnt make sense to translate everything  but if a ship is named  song of hatred  it should be translated  If a character is in space with no relation to anything on earth  earth doesnt exist in universe  then translating the names makes sense  You are saying  in instances where the cultural origin of the name is relevant  it doesnt make sense to translate the name  i completely agree with you  The cultural origin of the name doesnt always matter  sometimes the reference or implication of the name is what matters  If thats the case  translating it makes sense  if an alien species is named  hamsters  because they look like a hamsters  you can just call it a hamster i dont need to see it in the original language  the cultural origin of the word  hamster  is irrelevant in the context and story ;896
13v9pw9jm7ewab;13v9pw9;jm7ewab;Mr_Skecchi;30.05.2023 14:26;1.0;that would be totally good in my book  as long as the information is available in what im reading  If Tthe practice of editor translator notes like you see when you read in progress translations should just be extended out further to publish and cleaned up for the reader so they can understand easier  it would completely make my reading so much more enjoyable ;1055
13v9pw9jm698xc;13v9pw9;jm698xc;bofh000;30.05.2023 07:07;2.0;I m curious which names they translate in HP  because the ones that have meanings aren t the English ones  but the Latin based ones ;2329

13v9pw9jm4z1h2;13v9pw9;jm4z1h2;non_avian;30.05.2023 00:11;3.0;I think you re right about putting a translator note  I ve seen this in a lot of books  but I don t read a lot of contemporary fiction so I m not sure if it s as prevalent as it is in classics  If it s uncommon for translator notes in sci fi  for example  they should just translate it  This is done in other pop culture and no one complains  so I m not sure why this is different    it just seems like the cost of thorough translation is too high for what s ideal ;1625
13v9pw9jm5gjbg;13v9pw9;jm5gjbg;math-is-magic;30.05.2023 02:21;6.0;Yeah  and you know what  That s just not going to work in many cases   I read some C novels  one particularly popular example being Mo Dao Zu Shi  The Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation   Not only are none of the names translated  but many of the titles aren t either  Because there is just no way to translate them without paragraphs of explainer texts about the cultural implications  literary allusions  double play of character meanings  and the like  The few attempts that are made to translate these titles receive laughs from English speaker   his title is basically weed lord lol   and frustration from native speakers   no you guys it s actually a really poignant title the translation totally ruined it      But you know what  I know I m reading a novel in another language  Looking up name meanings  and even explainers on certain jokes and such  is  part of the experience   I ve learned a ton about the Chinese language and culture and history as a result of wanting to read these stories   Sometimes it s good to step outside your comfort bubble and learn more about the different cultures you re reading about ;118
13v9pw9jm7eeg6;13v9pw9;jm7eeg6;graviga-bunny;30.05.2023 14:23;2.0;I was just thinking about the translated names for the Ace Attorney characters in this same vein;1364

13v9pw9jm7ht4s;13v9pw9;jm7ht4s;White_crow606;30.05.2023 14:46;2.0;If it is fantasy or sci fi we are talking about  I agree that probably it would make more sense with translated names  because sometimes those names are also a sort of description of the fantasy race alien   I can completely feel you on the poor translations  In italian  we have  ti amo  and  ti voglio bene   Both of them are translated as  I love you   However   ti voglio bene  is more like  I care for you and wish you all well   no where as strong as  ti amo   the true  I love you  ;1420

13v9pw9jm548sf;13v9pw9;jm548sf;TechyDad;30.05.2023 00:51;7.0;So when an author writes a book  they should come up with a name for every character of theirs in every language  A quick googling says that there are 7 000 languages  but more than half of the population speaks 23 of them  Let s stay with those 23    Let s say that a book has 10 characters  Books can easily have way more  but we ll stick with 10  Right now  the author needs to pick 10 names  With your proposal  the author would need to pick 230 names  There s no way that an author would know enough about every language to get the name s meaning right in every language    The author could rely on translators  but then does the author need to copyright claim every new name  For example  if I published a  Harry Potter  book  JK Rowling would have cause to sue me  What if Harry Potter had 23 different names depending on the country the book was published in  though  Would my  Harry Potter  book be fine in Mexico where Harry was named something different  What if I was writing a Mexican character and used a name that JK picked for  Mexican Harry Potter    The whole idea of renaming characters for different countries languages would get way too complicated way too quickly ;942

13v9pw9jm5geot;13v9pw9;jm5geot;Mr_Skecchi;30.05.2023 02:20;-2.0;its ridiculously common in sci fi for people to name aliens and characters based on features and shit  and its being done in universe ex  chewie from chewbacca  the han solo stuff about chewie having eaten people and the stuff there wouldnt work in a translation because no one would translate that  Many characters in fantasy and sci fi go by nicknames half the time  and those dont get translated either because they are treated as proper nouns and not translated  It might be annoying and cliche but so is amnesia and its an easy way for an author to convey something with one word rather than doing it organically so it gets done a lot  And wouldnt you rather be able to see the red flags of cliche annoying when reading a translated book so you dont waste your time if you find them to be so  why would you want that hidden so you dont see the red flags  that you dont like them is more reason you should want warning thats what the author is doing  Also  naming people based on features is literally a core cultural tenent and just how names work in some places  some places have translatable terms inside them that should be translated  ex my own post  mohamed ibn mohamed   the ibn there means  son of  so its mohamed son of mohamed  indicating the son has the fathers name  Why is that part not translated 70  of the time i read an english translation of something arabic   im always free to learn the language myself  but i dont want to put that much effort in thats why im paying for a translated work  Why does the freedom to finish doing the job of the person i payed money to for a translation make it okay that they failed to translate all relevant words in the book  thats a stupid ass line to draw  Your only other argument is  proper nouns dont get translated because they are proper nouns  is  we draw the line there because thats where the line is   Which is a useless statement that doesnt explain why we dont translate proper nouns which is what my question you were trying to answer was dude ;1699
13v9pw9jm5x7hv;13v9pw9;jm5x7hv;Mr_Skecchi;30.05.2023 04:44;-1.0;I just conceded that it might not work in the comment you are responding to my dude  I wrote that my limited experience may have painted my perspective with the point about most the translated stuff ive read having come from phonetically written languages and that i could see your point about chinese from what i know of japanese  What more do you want from me  My point after that was  i have experienced cases where it works but i can see how there could be places where it wouldnt  I still think we should atleast try rather than giving up and making it homework   You have pointed out that there are cases where it wouldnt work  and argued cases where it wouldnt work  You have said nothing about why we shouldnt try  which is my point dude  The closest thing youve said is  step outside your bubble  but ive pointed out its not a problem of stepping outside the bubble  im saying we should atleast try to make the road to getting out of the bubble easier and less homeworky for people ;235
13v9pw9jm5xoup;13v9pw9;jm5xoup;lemmesenseyou;30.05.2023 04:49;10.0; if its a fantasy sci fi setting  and the name mael was chosen to show that the character is a common dude  I think you re underestimating the amount of thought sff authors put into their name choices  It d also make trying to discuss the work with someone who read it in a different language unbearable ;1370
13v9pw9jm5yr1z;13v9pw9;jm5yr1z;Mr_Skecchi;30.05.2023 05:01;-5.0;Authors put a  ton of work into every word lol  I think because ive read audiobooked a few things in 2 languages ive seen how much the structure of everything changes but can still give the same tone feeling experience when translated right that changing one more thing to better give the tone feeling experience isnt a big deal to me  I agree the author spent a lot of time choosing the name  and that the name has value  thats why i want it translated so that people can understand the value  If i didnt see the value of the effort they spent choosing the name  it wouldnt be valuable to me to understand it  if this was a matter of forgien names are hard  the find replace tool exists i can just pdf  text document and then replace it with whatever i want myself in less than the amount of time it would take to figure out the meaning of the name  And discussing the work with someone who read it in a different language is a pretty niche thing and not something most readers of the book will experience  so if translating it improves the experience  the harm done by affecting the communication seems worth it to me ;483
13v9pw9jm7j3d6;13v9pw9;jm7j3d6;[deleted];30.05.2023 14:55;5.0;I m multilingual and have read many books in English  French  and Spanish  I also majored in foreign language pedagogy in college and took multiple translation courses as part of my studies   You re entitled to your opinion  but please understand that the vast  vast majority of people disagree with you on this for the reasons I and others have laid out   Even if we ignore the artistic merit  it s completely impractical to have dozens of different names for each character  You haven t addressed those practical concerns which are more of an objective problem rather than a difference of opinion ;78
13v9pw9jm61ggr;13v9pw9;jm61ggr;lemmesenseyou;30.05.2023 05:31;2.0; the harm done by affecting the communication seems worth it to me   You might be in the minority there and it s not as niche as you might think  especially with international bestsellers  There s already an accessibility issue for the book community due to language and cultural barriers  what with the most prestigious prizes largely being in English  I don t think we need to make it worse   I think what you re describing is a niche thing  though  If the name was chosen  solely  for a punchline or something to that effect  it often is translated  When it s not  it s often because it s not a truly translatable thing or the name has another connotation  Or maybe the translator is just bad  I m not sure what specific examples you re thinking of  I read a lot of fiction in translation and I sure can t think of any that I thought would make sense with translated names   The point I was making with my first comment is that it s rarely just  I will name him Mael to show that he is male   It s often a specific spelling sound that the author just vibes with  how the word sounds is hugely important in naming things  Margarita and Daisy evoke two different feelings  for instance   or maybe they re trying to highlight his heritage  or they re riffing off a famous Mael or something  You lose that when you translate a name ;2384
13v9pw9jm7lkdn;13v9pw9;jm7lkdn;Mr_Skecchi;30.05.2023 15:11;1.0;I just dont see the practical issue with multiple names for a character  Its been done hundreds of times and has only become a problem for people recently  the aurthorian legends have different names for all their characters for each of the different languages in the region based on the meaning of their name  People didnt have a problem communicating about the legend of king aurthor obviously or it wouldnt have spread so much  You are saying its to much effort for people to go  who malificent  oh the evil antagonist named very hateful person in my language  but its not to much effort for a foreign reader to figure out that there is a meaning in the name malificent  and then go on a google search and deal with all the cultural shit to figure out its meaning  when as far as i remember shes the only one with such a name from the book  The rest all have normal names  meaning that if they had done that for the other characters it wouldve been a waste of time  of those one is objectively way more work than the other ;359

13v7l5fjm5sli6;13v7l5f;jm5sli6;CirenOtter;30.05.2023 03:58;23.0;Not a professional  but I believe the criteria is broad and most cases aren t severe enough for people to be aware of what s actually happening at it s core  Especially with all the disbelief in DID makes it even harder to diagnose  It s usually more subtle than it s depicted in stories  Most people just deal with it in the same way people ignore signs of severe bodily illness  We adapt and keep moving    Totally anecdotal  but just to offer an example I know a woman who has episodes that look like she s possessed by a spirit of her step dad   a man who abused her and then later killed himself while she was in the apartment  When she gets these attacks  her voice changes and her arms and face will start contorting  When  he  talks her voice is much deeper and takes a different intonation and tells her he s in control and more than once used her hands to touch her body  She is consciously present for the entire thing and able to discuss the helplessness and frustrating loss of control  Sometimes she can talk during the episode when  he  isn t talking  There isn t any reason to believe she s faking  There isn t a benefit to it  it s all just horrifying  She s a hardworking single mom who only has trouble keeping a job if he starts triggering at work  I think it actually triggers most when she is alone   which is a characteristic of the original abuse  It s debilitating and painful and embarrassing for her   But doctors won t believe or treat her because they say she s lying and it won t trigger when they are around  She can t afford or access therapy or specialists because doctors won t make the referral so it would be covered by insurance  Only the church believes her and she s had exorcisms that did not work because well  it s not a possession  To me it seems like she s reliving abuse she already endured  You could meet her and never know unless it happens in front of you  She s a perfectly pleasant and intelligent  normal person who has tried her best to get help and now just lives with it    That s the level of trauma we are talking about where it s happening in people who seem otherwise normal and there are a lot of people who have been through something that severe  And I think most cases that fit the criteria are more subtle than this example  Like say  someone who gets blackout drunk and becomes  another person  ;933

13v7l5fjm9bdle;13v7l5f;jm9bdle;aversethule;30.05.2023 21:49;1.0;I ve worked with a few   I don t think 1 5  is representative  although I have challenges with prevalence rates of many of the Dx as reported by the DSM  of the population at large   My theoretical formulation for DID is more along the lines of an extreme fight flight reaction  essentially a chronic and static dissociative response to trauma   I think the manifestation is similar in nature to how  typical  people may engage in escapism  fantasy  fetishes  etc    to find relief from the everyday stresses of the the real world   On a more functional level  this could be playing D D to various levels of commitment  to obsession with anime  to sports fanaticism   to almost whatever   I ve had a teen with a loaded trauma history who started out escaping into anime   As she found getting involved in that world she developed an online avatar for forums that emerged into a persona that turned into more of her life involvement than school and the  real world    As she aged the anime turned into K pop  and when I started working with her she was convinced she was going to move to Korea and become a K pop star   She never got to a DID state  imo  but I think it was on the spectrum to that   As we worked together  she was able to start integrating the two  identities   herself and her K pop self  and in high school was taking dance classes  Japanese  Chinese  and Korean language classes  and joined choir   As the integration continued  she began to express that she realized becoming a K pop star was not realistic for various reasons and then decided to work towards becoming a flim makeup stylist for a K pop agency   She graduated high school and entered beauty school and got a job at a stylist   Through the integration she was able to bring the two identities back into a cohesive self concept over time   While this is not DID  imo  it shows the spectrum and how it exists for all of us to some degree so we can look at an actual DID case   Childhood sexual abuse survivor  father at age 2   teacher in middle school who would abuse her at lunch after opening the emergency door to the outside so snow could blow in and cover the classroom floor before laying her down on it  etc      This trauma was is so overwhelming she had to escape the real world and mentally retreated into an escapism identity   As this vertical split in her psyche solidified  she cut of the original identity significantly in order to amputate the trauma wounds  if you will   However  since the abuse kept happening  and she was groomed to become vulnerable to future abuse as well   the new identity now had to be fled from as well and 3rd identity began to develop   So on and so on   Fast forward to her 30s and she reached a crisis point and during an inpatient stay the repressed memories began surfacing through the vertical splits to the  self    She s been doing great work and working towards integration and expresses a knowledge that her  alters  are compartmentalized memories experiences sealed off for emotional protection     So yeah  I absolutely think DID is a thing  but there is a natural and reasonable explanation of what it really is  which is not the sensationalized concept of DID is   I understand skepticism of it and all also  as culturally it is a thing we ve now collectively been taught  it s okay to claim this to get sympathy  and individuals may mask their protective behaviors as this form of adaptation ;841

13v4ybkjm45nt3;13v4ybk;jm45nt3;DidYouSetltToWumbo;29.05.2023 20:34;2.0;I chose team letter  For me it was the fact she never verbally spoke her side of the story  We are given the autobiography and the letter for both sides of her story  And When her cover was blown and she started to move from her coma  Jeremy was already on her choking her  I personally feel they didn t give Verity a fair chance to defend herself   And that s more or less the reason I chose the letter    Although I would love to hear why you think I m Wrong;1162
13v4ybkjm530m6;13v4ybk;jm530m6;mudarke;30.05.2023 00:42;2.0;i read this story about a year ago and i still can t choose a side lmaoooo  the story messed me up;329
13v4ybkjm5ff8m;13v4ybk;jm5ff8m;gummybear256;30.05.2023 02:14;2.0;I couldn t stop thinking about this for WEEKS after  I m team autobiography  mostly because it was so messed up that I didn t think anyone could write something so awful about their own kids  Definitely one of my favorite reads last year     x200B   If you liked Verity  try the  Silent Patient   I actually screamed and threw my kindle after reading it  One of my favs;352
13v4ybkjm44lhr;13v4ybk;jm44lhr;Kamylee1;29.05.2023 20:27;3.0;But then why she write so much unbelievable things in autobiography   I can t understand why she just write so much bad thing  If letter its true I can t imagine what was in her head that moment when she writing about how she murder her daughters ;668
13v4ybkjm494t3;13v4ybk;jm494t3;Kamylee1;29.05.2023 20:58;2.0;what would be your rating of  Verity     And thank you for your recommendation  I will read it  ;1367
13v4ybkjm47n2p;13v4ybk;jm47n2p;the-dream-walker-;29.05.2023 20:48;1.0;Yeah that s one of the reasons why I think the letter may atleast partly be true  Jeremy seemed to take the rope Lowan tossed at him and get exactly what he wanted  There s also the fact that Lowan is an unreliable narrator because she s practically already in love with the dude while meeting him in a damn traffic accident if not a bunch of other reasons ;185
13v4ybkjm47zfu;13v4ybk;jm47zfu;Kamylee1;29.05.2023 20:50;1.0;Firstly  I don t think you are wrong because this story do not have correct answer   I actually in both sides and cannot chose one   While I was reading the autobiography all the time I was thinking  what is wrong with this woman   The story about the Jeremy and Lowen world make sense about autobiography  Jeremy is calm  super daddy and lovely husband  Crew is one of the survived childrens  Everything looks normal  Actually  i hate Verity  I do not understand how che can be that type of woman and mother  When in the story end shows up the letter I look at her with different eyes  She present her self like very calm and loves childrens mother  She actually hate her husband  So much hate him  But I can t understand how her heart let her write about how she murders her twin  I can understand why all the times she pretend to be in coma  and this two thinks do not let me choose letter side;1880
13v4ybkjm476hg;13v4ybk;jm476hg;the-dream-walker-;29.05.2023 20:44;2.0;It s a bit of a quandary  Exactly as CoHo intended  I think Jeremy genuinely is a psychopath if not effin insane  because Verity s death may have been rage but Patricia sure as hell was calculated   But it s also just as likely that the letter is false  The scene where Jeremy throws the dumplings at the wall and they fight about Harper and Chastin really show that Verity is more than capable of manipulating a situation to her advantage     ;686

13v4ybkjm4c28x;13v4ybk;jm4c28x;DidYouSetltToWumbo;29.05.2023 21:18;2.0;Verity was given advice to write in this negative perspective to help with her own books that were in the villains point of view  How her heart managed to handle writing those awful things is beyond me  Though I did hear that writing in bad times could also help cope with the situation ;56

13v4ybkjm494ev;13v4ybk;jm494ev;the-dream-walker-;29.05.2023 20:58;1.0;And to further my argument  the only times when Verity s writing voice seem similar is the dumpling toss scene and her letter   You could take it as proof the letter was a lie    Or that it was true and she d woven her real self into the book ;2217

13uqghgjm40k2k;13uqghg;jm40k2k;BlessdRTheFreaks;29.05.2023 19:59;3.0;  Finished  SPOILERS        The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner           The more I think about it  the more I love it  This ll sound dramatic  but I cancelled my plans for the day after the Quentin chapter  It reminded me a lot about my relationship with my father who died by suicide and my own struggles with suicide  Specifically  I remembered a childhood memory where my dad went rafting with his friends and almost drowned  He told me he was shocked when his friends pulled him back up that he wasn t at all afraid and he regretted that they saved him from drowning  This whole chapter is Quentin reflecting on his search to define a positive meaning for life in spite of his desolate family home  his relationship with his nihilistic father who says no battle is ever won  the field only reveals men s folly  He reflects on the peacefulness of the water and how he won t struggle with the pain of his past  the hopelessness of his future  and the meaninglessness of his present  Quentin seems like the only character trying to create a positive way of being in the world  and in the end the negative voices win and he chooses the peacefulness of the waters  It fucked me up  Especially the way it s written and how his thoughts rapidly blend together with his painful memories as he leaves to drown himself  If anyone has known crisis  the end of Quentin s chapter perfectly captures the thought process of crisis           The part that made me feel like I understood the book was Luster s quest to make the saw sound like a banjo  That s what reading the book feels like  It feels like it s on the edge of grasping something deep and profound  but  a the title suggests  it is merely a tale told by an idiot  full of sound and fury  signifying nothing  That s what Luster s doing  in a way  Striking a dead saw with a hammer in the hopes to make it sing beautiful music  I don t know why but that felt profoundly moving to me        The Wanderer by Khalil Ghibran     This is a collection of short allegories by the famed Lebanese writer  poet  and artist  I really  really loved this book  I read most of it camping  or while I was having my morning coffee  Each story is between 1 4 pages  so you can always finish one in a sitting and spend time thinking about it as you go about your morning routine  A few stood out to me as true wisdom  and I love how he uses the archetype of the madman as being the only person who perceives the truth of the world   My favorites were        The story of the crocodile and the hyena  The crocodile laments that everyone dismisses his sorrow because they suspect all his tears are crocodile tears  The hyena compares and says that when he laughs at the true marvels and joys of the world  they dismiss it as the laughter of a hyena          The story of the two oysters  where one laments the pain of bearing a pearl inside himself  The other oyster rejoices that he is healthy and does not have to bear the burden of the pearl  A passing crab points out that the pearl the pain stricken oyster bears is one of exceeding beauty    to me it means that we should not regret the pain and sorrow of our experiences  It is this experience that is what is truly beautiful in life and will give our life meaning  all the heartbreak  dashed dreams  and trials of suffering           I also like the story of the two poets  One writes an impressive poem exalting almighty Zeus  hoping to be remembered through the years as a magnificent and mighty poet  The other poet writes about a small personal experience of two children playing in a garden  The poet who writes of Zeus is remembered through the ages but neither liked nor celebrated  the poet that writes of the children is beloved throughout all time    as a poet myself  this story reminds me that what we write to impress others gets away from the purpose of writing  which is to reveal the emotional truth of our experiences  What is valuable in our art is what is humble  honest  and personal     I liked many others but these are what I remember in the moment    Started  NO SPOILERS     The Island by Aldous Huxley  So far I like where it s going  I m only 3 chapters in  Aldous Huxley s themes are very close to the way I see reality and the problems of society  but I don t really like his writing style  or at least it hasn t grown on me yet  Some expressions are beautiful  and I love how he creates characters  but the way the action is directed often seems hard to follow  I feel like I m supposed to following the plot  and it s not written in a way to be intentionally incomprehensible  Like The Sound and the Fury  but his voice isn t as clear or as strong as someone like Orwell  who he is often compared against  perhaps unfairly   I hope to get used to his writing as it goes on and maybe come to appreciate his style more     x200B     MADE PROGRESS IN    The Art of Drowning by Billy Collins  I really like it  I like the Thesaurus poem quite a bit  Billy Collins is the cool uncle of poetry   Ranier Marie Rilke selected works  Really hit or miss for me  Some are profoundly moving and hit you on this otherworldly level  Maidens  for example   others I have no idea what he s saying and it could just as easily be hieroglyphics  I hope to be able to read and understand him in German some day   The Flowers of Evil by Baudelaire  The New Directions version  I love  love  love this book  His turns of phrase are so cool and the dreamy imagery he conjures up takes you to this mystical far off place  I hope to read him in French some far off day   The Ode Less Traveled by Stephen Fry  Super fun and accessible book that makes you love the English language more than you

13upf0ijm6ofi8;13upf0i;jm6ofi8;Professor_JT;30.05.2023 10:35;1.0;Saying listening to audio books is  reading  is incorrect  If I rode my bike to work  I wouldn t call it riding in a car  In a world where everybody wants a trophy language itself threatens to be redefined in the name of  inclusivity   Unfortunately  reading is a singular experience  which requires sustained attention  You must delay instant gratification  You must sit down doing nothing but looking at a book  You can t do the dishes  You can t drive a car   Many struggle to read books because it is a skill  it is challenging  and because public school does a terrible job teaching literacy  I would know  I did not develop the habit of reading until I was well into my 30s  I could of course READ but reading books is a different skill entirely   Many feel bad that they can t read or don t real  They feel insecure like they  can t  for whatever reason  Many fail to understand how to form habits  but it is true  reading is not something everybody can do  Reading skillfully is not something everyone can do  The narrative I see here time and time again is people finding audiobooks and suddenly feeling  included  like they are a  reader    This is all good and fine  if you want to discuss books  or the knowledge contained therein  However  it is my experience  that those who listen to an audiobook typically can t say what the book was about  or recall the most simple aspects  only little bits here and there  in other words they have failed to grasp the big picture  Reading Anna Karenina and Moby Dick for example  were two books that I absolutely adore  to process these works I read them  went back  underlined passages  circled words  there is a lot of extra stuff that goes on when you are reading a great book   Instead of redefining the word  reading  because  what s the difference   I think it is important to highlight the many differences in reading  what makes reading so important and wonderful as an act  Why it is historically significant  Why it is the antidote to many of the world s modern problems  The need for instant gratification  short attention span  etc  Those that listen to audiobooks  can certainly participate in a discussion about any book  they can learn from this medium  Listening has it s merits  You can call them books  because a book is a vehicle for information  However   reading  is different  it is the method for which information is absorbed   Calling audiobooks reading doesn t help those insecure few who want a pat on the back and validation because now they read  They know in their heart of hearts that it is NOT reading  hence the vitriol in this absurd discussion  That energy could be directed at actually reading  discovering the differene first hand  and being validated not externally  but internally ;632

13unn9qjm3774k;13unn9q;jm3774k;hgaterms;29.05.2023 16:41;2.0;  Surprising that this hasn t been made into a movie  So  the movie rights have been snatched up by directors Lord and Miller  and in a podcast recently Andy Weir said that the directors want to have all the scenes be realistic with the 1 6th gravity on screen   Which means a lot of wire work  honestly    At the moment the directors are focusing on Project Hail Mary  so I think the movie rights for Artemis are going to extinguish before they ever get around to it   I cannot wait to see how an Artemis movie plays out   I feel like it can become a better movie than it was a book ;950

13unn9qjm39v6l;13unn9q;jm39v6l;hgaterms;29.05.2023 16:59;-1.0;  fact the plot isn t all that good or unique   Let s be honest  there are only 9 stories in the history of humanity   They are all just recycled over and over again   What Andy Weir creates is his own personal flavor on the same stories we ve heard before   And boy do I love that seasoning he makes   The Martian was his story of  man vs nature   Artemis was his  heist  story  Project Hail Mary was his version of a sci fi  first contact  scenario ;1497

13unn9qjm1o6h7;13unn9q;jm1o6h7;networkarchitect;29.05.2023 08:04;6.0;Artemis is a bit of a divisive one  personally I quite enjoyed it but I also think it s the weakest of Weir s scifi works  when compared against The Martian and Project Hail Mary   I think its biggest weakness is the perspective it s written from  Weir s writing style and dialogue choices gave off the  man trying a bit too hard to write from a woman s perspective  vibe in places  I think this is mostly due to his skills as a writer  overall I like the choice of a female protagonist but it did not play to Weir s writing strengths   It was also his second scifi book that followed after the success of The Martian  which led some people in with high expectations  If you haven t read it yet  Project Hail Mary more than lives up to those expectations ;635

13unn9qjm557xb;13unn9q;jm557xb;[deleted];30.05.2023 00:58;2.0;His fans tend to be extremely passionate about his works  When you have an in depth discussion with any of them  eventually they admit that the books fail to have complex characters  good prose or dialog  coherent themes  meaningful character arcs  good pacing  etc   People love these books because they re mindless thrillers with enough science sounding words to make you feel smart while you re reading them  It s the same reason that movies like Fast   Furious are really popular except since they re books that use science words occasionally  it avoids the stigma that people have with most mindless thriller content like that   To be clear  there s nothing wrong with loving Weir s work  I think he s fantastic at creating this type of content  and it s easy to do it as well as he does  But his works are terrible in terms of literary value  in the same way that you wouldn t watch Snakes on a Plane for a deep analysis of human behavior   And it s pretty clear reading his novels that he s basically writing screenplays at this point  PHM specifically read just like a Hollywood movie ;1422
13unn9qjm1omn5;13unn9q;jm1omn5;maaku7;29.05.2023 08:10;7.0;  I think this is mostly due to his skills as a writer  overall I like the choice of a female protagonist but it did not play to Weir s writing strengths   I think that is a really good way of putting it  Jazz was a good character  But he was very clearly writing outside of his element  and the story didn t play to his strengths as a writer  I think there s a reason he went back to Mark Whitney 2 0 with Project Hail Mary ;114

13unn9qjm3ak6x;13unn9q;jm3ak6x;hgaterms;29.05.2023 17:03;1.0;Andy Weir has said that one of the flaws of  The Martian  is that Mark Watney is an unchanged character   He s the same at the end of the book as he was at the beginning   He had no flaws and no growth    So Weir course corrected with Jazz in  Artemis  but swung too hard in the opposite direction and made Jazz too unlikeable and too unredeemable   In Project Hail Mary  he made Ryland Grace with a much better balance   And PHM became his masterpeice in my opinion ;535

13uj352jm1oui1;13uj352;jm1oui1;ThuliumNice;29.05.2023 08:13;2.0;This is a really interesting question  that I think the book leaves not entirely answered   I think I remember that in his final written confession  Dr  James Sheppard mentions that he suspects his sister already knows  as he recounts his sister mentioning his  weakness      Poirot is in some ways a keen judge of character  so perhaps Poirot also knows that Caroline knows   But then there s a difference between knowing for sure  and only suspecting strongly   Also  if Sheppard isn t arrested  him being the culprit will be much less publicly known   On an only slightly related note  the novel Curtain   explores Poirot s ethics and the idea of culpability when you convince others to murder on your behalf   By Poirot s worldview later in the novel series  Poirot should have considered encouraging Dr  James Sheppard to commit suicide to be murder  and should have avoided it    ;476

14br2pdjoj2o3y;14br2pd;joj2o3y;afancycatnamedmike;18.06.2023 00:06;3.0;It s more about people being incapable of differentiate reality from fiction   But now I think about it  dystopia and utopia are pretty subjective term  like saying ugliness and beauty ;154

13x4ss0jmfqmum;13x4ss0;jmfqmum;KaiBishop;1.06.2023 04:29;34.0;I honestly think there is a LOT of good YA dystopia people will dismiss as Hunger Games clones but in reality are great on their own and even have meta commentary on the genre  Iron Widow comes to mind as a recent one with several plot decisions feeling like they were made to directly contrast to THG and the heroine archetype it popularized  the reluctant revolutionary  which was a nice change of pace for the genre   I love The Chemical Garden trilogy by Lauren DeStefano  it gets a bad rap from people who found the slower more character driven nature of it boring but I love the entire trilogy and honestly found it a rumination on grief and how it shapes your entire life  watching an entire culture rot in the face of imminent extinction  Across The Universe by Beth Revis is a great look at how a cool horrifying microstate could develop on a generation ship and has lots of sci fi stuff mixed in but is mainly dystopian  the exploration of the justifications and rhetoric tyrants will tell themselves and nature of coverups  how corrupt hierarchies always have another level of bullshit once you peel away the last one   Matched by Allie Condie really makes me mad  Everyone remembers it as a love triangle book because that s how the marketing depicts it but I swear there s not even a love triangle  The entire theme is that poetry and literature are threats to fascism and learning to write poetry and read banned books is rebellion and how art can wake you up and open your eyes  Literally everyone who remembers it rips on it for something the marketing insists is there to market to teen girls  but isn t really present in the book  Annoying because I think it s poetic and endearing with themes of censorship and surveillance but people dunk on it for assumed reasons that just don t add up   The best one nobody knows about is Defiance by CJ Redwine  That trilogy is the most balls to the wall  action packed  dragon infested dystopian I have encountered  One city state represents brutal misogyny and another is used to explore the idea of punishment  guilt  crime  etc  and did I mention it s dragon infested  The depiction of depression and grief with the character Rachel was also really good  And the action scenes hold up for me on every reread   Ultimately ya dystopian as a genre deserves a little more credit than it gets tbh ;1065
13x4ss0jmflhua;13x4ss0;jmflhua;flouronmypjs;1.06.2023 03:41;20.0;I am constantly encouraging friends and family to read this series  I love it  I first read it when I was in my mid twenties  so not as a teenager  I ve re read it several times since  It s often described as YA but I really think this is a series that can be a good fit for any age of adult  There is so much deoth and darkness  and so much heart  Wonderful  gut wrenching books ;328
13x4ss0jmian4x;13x4ss0;jmian4x;dustarook;1.06.2023 18:14;5.0;The first book was the best  The 2nd two seemed to decline in quality quite a bit  I could tell with the 3rd that things just felt rushed and the author was just trying to meet deadlines to get a book out ;2271

13x4ss0jmh28ru;13x4ss0;jmh28ru;Hephaestus_God;1.06.2023 13:27;3.0;We read it in our middle school English class when it came out  Best school book I ve ever read haha   Actually made me want to read the rest of the series ;34
13x4ss0jmhzcdv;13x4ss0;jmhzcdv;tdmoney;1.06.2023 17:03;3.0;My major criticism about the book is that it is written in a first person perspective  I would have liked to know more about other districts other tributes    Plus it gave away the ending  There was never going to be a time where  and then I died ;616
13x4ss0jmjh0o1;13x4ss0;jmjh0o1;Interesting-Fish6065;1.06.2023 22:48;3.0;The Hunger Games is an exceptional book that requires no qualifiers  YA  dystopian romance  etc    It s just really really good and quite possibly great IMHO ;1243
13x4ss0jmggv0b;13x4ss0;jmggv0b;eivind2610;1.06.2023 10:03;9.0;My mum used to be a librarian  specializing in kids  and teens  books  and would often use me as her  test subject  when something new came in  I remember reading Hunger Games when it was brand new   before it gained traction as a  threeway romance drama  and started being advertised to teen girls   and I really loved it  I should re read it some time soon  I remember enough to know there are a lot of little details I ve forgotten about  that I d like to be reminded of   I do have to say  though  that the author s claim that they weren t familiar with Battle Royale before writing Hunger Games sounds like bullshit to me ;314
13x4ss0jmg00gb;13x4ss0;jmg00gb;inbloomgc;1.06.2023 06:12;11.0;I still think about some of the harrowing scenes from that book to this day  Katniss starving and Peeta leaving her the bread  Rue s fate  Katniss and Peeta huddled while listening to Cato s brutal demise Evocative writing and deep themes  Hunger Games is still one of the best ;1975
13x4ss0jmguk1m;13x4ss0;jmguk1m;omegapisquared;1.06.2023 12:26;7.0;I tell this to everyone I can  It feels weird to describe a global successful franchise as underrated but I feel like most people remember Hunger Games for the films which were a pretty shallow adaptation of the source material  and as a consequence it gets lumped in with things like Twilight or the numerous copycat dystopian YA series that came to follow       One of the things I really enjoyed was having Katniss as an actually flawed protagonist who is constantly having to weigh the desire to do the right thing against her first instinct to just survive;460
13x4ss0jmgzsap;13x4ss0;jmgzsap;Possibly-Satan;1.06.2023 13:08;5.0;I only liked the first book to be honest  I read the second one and was like  nope  predictable and ridiculous  It s far better than most in the genre but I didn t want to waste my time  Thankfully I can just reread the first one ;951
13x4ss0jmh69je;13x4ss0;jmh69je;RealBrookeSchwartz;1.06.2023 13:56;4.0;TW  Spoilers  The Hunger Games is excellent and I have always thought this  Not only is the romance between Katniss and Peeta very well done  but the romance between Katniss and Gale is similarly well done  as well as the contrasts between Gale and Peeta that echo what Katniss feels and needs at different points in her journey the story     Also  as heartbreaking as Prim s death was  it was necessary for the story because one of its main points is that the innocent cannot be protected in war  Katniss sacrificed everything to save one innocent person  and caused the entire story to set in motion because of this action  and yet in the end her mission failed because good things cannot survive in a bad world     I d highly recommend  this  https   www hypable com mockingjay why prim needed to die   analysis   Here s a quote from it      It s clear from the beginning that Prim doesn t belong in this world  If anything close to Absolute Truth makes an appearance in the series  it s Prim  In fact  Prim embodies everything good  innocent  and pure  Peeta is a close second  but still not on the same level as Prim  After all  he is willing to kill other tributes if he must  while Prim can t let a cat die        That s why Katniss volunteering at the Reaping is even more significant  She s volunteering to save her sister  yes  but symbolically  she s volunteering to fight for and save everything that s good      There are many other deeper themes that are explored the uselessness of material goods in the face of things like life and death  the unfairness of wealth disparity  the impact of even small acts of bravery  It s a complex  timeless package of human truths wrapped in a cloak of YA fiction ;2068
13x4ss0jmg0eyk;13x4ss0;jmg0eyk;SleepingBakery;1.06.2023 06:17;2.0;I actually hadn t read or watched the hunger games ever until last month  I devoured the audiobooks back to back  This series holds up very very well and is an absolute masterpiece  It s the peak of what YA has to offer   The prequel definitely wasn t it though but I m just going to pretend I never read it  ;1028
13x4ss0jmgpncn;13x4ss0;jmgpncn;heelsandbooks;1.06.2023 11:41;2.0;I swear I was just eying my copies of the hunger games for a reread  and this review convinced me   Thanks ;264

13x4ss0jmhso73;13x4ss0;jmhso73;wishyouwerehere58;1.06.2023 16:21;2.0;I m currently rereading the series and I am surprised at how well written it is   I remember reading it many years ago and enjoyed it but wasn t impressed technically  But now  I feel its a very well written series  even without the YA label ;888
13x4ss0jmhsxrj;13x4ss0;jmhsxrj;wpo97;1.06.2023 16:23;2.0;It s just a shame that its sequels don t live up to it  The second book is a decent but shallow clone  and the third one is just a straight up mess  The author was not ready as a writer to attempt the storylines of the third book ;784
13x4ss0jmhu5af;13x4ss0;jmhu5af;megalomike;1.06.2023 16:30;2.0;i didnt understand why a society that has technology that is essentially magic needed to oppress coal miners ;1536
13x4ss0jmhvlnl;13x4ss0;jmhvlnl;lexkixass;1.06.2023 16:40;2.0;I personally couldn t stand Katniss while reading  Liked the other stuff in the books  but I struggled to empathize with her actions especially in the third book   Can t give specifics as it s been years since I read it ;2199
13x4ss0jmi4mh9;13x4ss0;jmi4mh9;BetterTumbleweed1746;1.06.2023 17:36;2.0;Suzanna Collins is great  I loved her before Hunger Games for the Underlander Chronicles  which is still the best kids series imo  Dark and deeply compelling like Animorphs  crazy that they got away with it tbh  Also  fun fact she wrote for Clifford the Big Red Dog puppy years tv show   D  I fell away from Hunger Games when they started making movies about it  which honestly idk how I feel about them still  Not the quality of the movies but the fact that they exist  when the whole point of the books was that it was gross to watch children kill each other on TV  But I m glad it introduced the books to more people and Collins got her paycheck ;1070
13x4ss0jmib4u7;13x4ss0;jmib4u7;idfk78;1.06.2023 18:17;2.0;These books are soooo good  Literally  Every  Single  Time  I open one of them up I find something new  some new nuance or meaning or detail that I hadn t registered before ;1680
13x4ss0jmic9f2;13x4ss0;jmic9f2;meg8278;1.06.2023 18:24;2.0;I loved those books  I was actually given a recommendation by one of the parents at the daycare that I worked at  She said I don t know if you ll like the fact of kids getting hurt  Which she wasn t wrong about that  But I thoroughly enjoyed those books  I just actually got my daughter into reading them  She s not quite old enough to understand all the nuance of everything  But she does get some of it  You ve kind of made me want to reread them ;1889
13x4ss0jmid314;13x4ss0;jmid314;RuleRepresentative94;1.06.2023 18:29;2.0;This book made my kid read  Its amazing;492

13x4ss0jmj7az9;13x4ss0;jmj7az9;Asleep-Journalist-94;1.06.2023 21:40;2.0;Of all the popular novels I wish I could ve written  this may top the list  It was perfectly timed and realized and just had everything   suspense  conflict  romance  heroism  tragedy and above all  relevance  And as a bonus the films are pretty darn great ;1469
13x4ss0jmj7zxv;13x4ss0;jmj7zxv;Scrapbookee;1.06.2023 21:45;2.0;While I love the books  I have always thought the books as a whole would have worked better if we alternated between Peeta and Katniss chapters  At least during the first two books  it would be interesting to feel like I got to know Peeta better ;1488
13x4ss0jmjyao4;13x4ss0;jmjyao4;loneliestdozer;2.06.2023 00:55;2.0;In my 30s and still really go for this series ;613
13x4ss0jmk4vg2;13x4ss0;jmk4vg2;curmudgeon_andy;2.06.2023 01:45;2.0; The Hunger Games  is challenging because of how compelling it is  It s a page turner  Whenever I start reading it  I can t stop  I love seeing the way that Katniss uses her smarts and her skills to solve the impossible puzzles she s been set  and that sort of action is so gripping  and the horribleness she s fighting against so immediate for the first two books  that it s easy to forget all of the themes that you mentioned  the surveillance  the nature of the Games  and the sort of implied meta commentary about us as readers   the way the romance itself also becomes a sort of puzzle  Every time I read it  I feel like there s so much going on in the depths that I m just not seeing because I m so distracted by the action  I feel like other dystopian YA novels that followed it got the trappings and the look but missed the heart ;99
13x4ss0jmgswal;13x4ss0;jmgswal;MisterB78;1.06.2023 12:11;10.0;The Hunger Games is one of those series that should have stopped after one book   She clearly had very cool ideas about this dystopian world and the games themselves  but didn t know how to write a revolution ;1447
13x4ss0jmh3rb5;13x4ss0;jmh3rb5;[deleted];1.06.2023 13:38;5.0;IMO The Hunger Games holds up so well because of the way it deconstructs typical tropes in YA fiction  Katniss is good with a bow but that is it  she is not a chosen one  not a good leader or anything of the like  She just kinda happens to be there at the right time for the District 13 and the rebels to use her as a mascot ;813
13x4ss0jmfn8dm;13x4ss0;jmfn8dm;lookovertheremum;1.06.2023 03:57;5.0;I read this a few years ago when my daughter had just read it at age 11  It really is much more than YA   it holds up well against any dystopian SF  which is my favourite genre  ;1442
13x4ss0jmgfs5b;13x4ss0;jmgfs5b;lyss_grace;1.06.2023 09:48;4.0;Was honestly my favourite trilogy growing up  I picked it up over and over again ;847
13x4ss0jmgq2d6;13x4ss0;jmgq2d6;Ok_Ad_88;1.06.2023 11:45;3.0;I definitely enjoyed hunger games quite a bit one of those books that you can just churn through   IMO Mistborn is a better dystopian teen drama  It is in a different lane however because of the supernatural elements    Another darker and more adult dystopia trilogy I enjoyed was the broken earth series   Another much darker and more fantastical dystopian trilogy I enjoyed was  The prince of nothing  series  Much harder to digest  more poetic  but also more brutal  You will learn a lot of vocabulary from this series   Happy reading book nerds ;761
13x4ss0jmhj6cc;13x4ss0;jmhj6cc;ResoluteClover;1.06.2023 15:22;4.0;The thing that always bothered me about the movies was the romance  She makes it clear in the book katniss cares primarily about her sister and after that making sure as few people get hurt as possible  She only ever hurts someone else in defense    There was never an internalized love triangle  she just worked the camera with Pita ;2447
13x4ss0jmhmh5b;13x4ss0;jmhmh5b;Tman1677;1.06.2023 15:43;2.0;People dismiss it because of the trend it started but there s a reason it started the trend   it s a genuinely great series  I was a little shocked upon reread as an adult Joe well both of Collins s works The Hunger Games and Gregor the Overlander held up ;951

13x4ss0jmhqmu7;13x4ss0;jmhqmu7;SuckHerClit;1.06.2023 16:09;2.0;Now try Battle Royale next  It totally changed my opinion of The Hunger Games  It is a similar  much older novel that s better in almost every way as long as you can follow the Japanese names  I loved The Hunger Games  but it feels like a cheap American knockoff after reading Battle Royale ;2266
13x4ss0jmfvgq7;13x4ss0;jmfvgq7;autumn-be-here-soon;1.06.2023 05:19;2.0;My favorite series to this day;1232
13x4ss0jmgqj4i;13x4ss0;jmgqj4i;[deleted];1.06.2023 11:50;3.0;It is one of my absolute Fave series of all time  I would rank it above Harry Potter  because that deals with some of the same themes but I think because of the magic aspect of HP  some of the seriousness of those themes gets lost in the surrealism  HG is raw and brutal  There are some really heartbreaking things that come to light in the last book  things that kids and teens don t necessarily think about when it comes to totalitarian government  like human trafficking   Katniss and Peeta are my top favorite couple of all time just because it reminds me of my husband and I so much  They re personalities  mainly  but just how much they go through and still manage to protect each other and support one another  no matter what they need to do  It s realistic  even with it s not so great parts  which is what makes it realistic  He is literally the only person there for her toward the end and it makes such a difference in her personality   And  if you do decide to continue the series  just know that the  love triangle  bullshit  is just that  bullshit  The movies tried to follow the YA trend of a girl having two male lovers but it s not like that in the books  Katniss is horribly scarred emotionally and mentally and she s just trying to survive  It s not until toward the end of the second book she even considers what being in love would be like and it s all erased once she is hit with more trauma  Katniss  only concerns are Prim and  in the arena and Capitol  Peeta  But it s just  what do I have to do to keep everyone safe  Which is a lot for any adult let alone a 16 year old girl  I like that this was Collins  take on it  Silliness and  omg  which boy is cuter    has no place in HG ;1771
13x4ss0jmhgyxu;13x4ss0;jmhgyxu;cMeeber;1.06.2023 15:08;2.0;I thought it was pretty good  And I love the commentary on late stage capitalism and the current state of  democracy    I ve noticed a lot of people have tried to reduce it some kind of bad teen love triangle romance and I can t help but think that take comes from a place of misogyny  Like  it s actually very unromantic  Katniss is pretty much incapable of romantic and vulnerable sentimentality  She s too traumatized and defensive  Anyone thinking it s a love triangle story just has bad reading comprehension or just has never read it period ;2014
13x4ss0jmh5jud;13x4ss0;jmh5jud;JAHalliday;1.06.2023 13:51;1.0;Has anyone here read both The Hunger Games and Red Rising    I read Red Rising recently and really enjoyed it  and the comparison everyone seems to make is to The Hunger Games     I ve seen The Hunger Games films  so I realise already the plots are quite similar  I m more interested in how they compare in a literary sense  ;1044
13x4ss0jmgem58;13x4ss0;jmgem58;LordLaz1985;1.06.2023 09:32;0.0;I m still mad at how the movies handled things   They and the commercial tie ins played heavy into the spectacle which is the same shit the author was trying to condemn in the first place ;1183
13x4ss0jmngw96;13x4ss0;jmngw96;grungebob_scarepants;2.06.2023 19:17;1.0;Honestly  I think The Hunger Games holds up better than Harry Potter and will have a better legacy in the long run ;1360
13x4ss0jmnpdyn;13x4ss0;jmnpdyn;NinjaBnny;2.06.2023 20:15;1.0;I m literally rereading the series right now  One thing that really struck me when I first picked it up again as an adult is how carefully Katniss  trauma responses are written  They feel so real because she s not aware of them as they re happening  She just ACTS  You can see it happening in the arena  but it s major when she gets out  She gets triggered during an interview at the end and immediately hides her face in Peeta s shirt  Beginning of the book Katniss wouldn t be caught dead showing something like that  But in the moment she just does it and then mentions that it takes them a few minutes to coax her back out  Just says it like that s normal  She doesn t even question it    She s constantly trying to figure out her feelings  his feelings  how she should act to keep them safe  but with a treacherous body that acts how it wants to at the same time  She s lucky that what her body did on instinct was things like  cling to Peeta and don t let go   Idk I just love how you can see the slow breakdown of her usual behaviors in the face of this huge ongoing traumatic event and how it affects her in the aftermath without the author ever actually pointing it out  I feel like a lot of authors would feel the need to lampshade it or have the character question their actions to make sure the audience picks up on it  but in real life most people don t notice their trauma responses while they re doing them  Suzanne Collins trusted the audience to pick up on it anyway;1694

13x4ss0jmkf2uq;13x4ss0;jmkf2uq;kharmatika;2.06.2023 03:05;4.0;The films  and more horrifically the marketing for the films  I remember maybelline having two eye palettes come out  one called  the capital  which did a great glam eye  and one called  the Districts  which did a smoky eye   And the marketing was like  the rebellion is coming  who will you fight for   And I m just sitting here like sooooooo this is what the book was LITERALLY ABOUT ;153
13x4ss0jmifqk0;13x4ss0;jmifqk0;MeropeRedpath;1.06.2023 18:45;16.0;I don t know if I agree  I thought book 3  even though it was depressing to read because it didn t feel like Katniss was a hero anymore  or was doing anything really  was actually a very good representation about what happens to the figurehead of a rebellion  Katniss had no agency by book 3  She was a prop  And her mental state is in fact very realistic    Book 3 doesn t describe a revolution   it all happens unsaid  in the background  We barely see any of it  because Katniss isn t actually revolting  She s being used  manipulated  the same way the powers that be are manipulating the districts  And I did feel that book 3 described that quite well  It wasn t particularly satisfying to read  but it certainly stayed true to the author s message ;763
13x4ss0jmh1thk;13x4ss0;jmh1thk;Gigantosaurous;1.06.2023 13:24;1.0;Totally agree   The original book was great as a stand alone story   Then it was like the publisher author wanted to cash in and put out two more unnecessary and mediocre books and turn it into a  series    You see that a lot these days ;931

13x4ss0jmmgorw;13x4ss0;jmmgorw;Joe_Metaphor;2.06.2023 15:22;0.0;I m a huge fan of the series  but I read it completely differently from a political standpoint  The Capitol was a right wing caricature of the urban liberal elite   they controlled the wealth and media  oppressed the rural working class  forced their  perverse  values on them and restricted their traditional lifestyles  Capitol residents are all portrayed as dandyish and effeminate  so   gay     Meanwhile  the District people are honorable  hardworking country folk with traditional values  I m OK with right wing fiction if it s entertaining and not too crazy  so the political subtext didn t bother me  but imo there was no other way to interpret the series as anything but a right wing fever dream ;1186

13x4ss0jmmryvg;13x4ss0;jmmryvg;cMeeber;2.06.2023 16:35;1.0;Looking at the style of capitol residents is superficial  What clothes people wear has nothing to do with power structures  The ostentatious styles of the capitol isn t supposed to depict them as  liberal  but as decadent as image obsessed they dont have to be practical and have money to spend and dedicating themselves to trends is a way to show off their wealth and status    Look at France before the revolution  Men were wearing wigs  heels  and literal make up and beauty marks  It had nothing to do being gay it was just the style at the time  There was still a literal king  You can t get more right wing than a literal King lol even if he s in makeup and a long wig  Clothes aren t what makes something left or right wing  The nobles were spending and living lavishly while pedants were starving   Looking at that as  the effeminate men are overlording it over us simple traditional folk  is the type of myopic view Fox News exactly does push lol  They get people mad about  the gays  so they don t get mad at the actually people in power or the actual problems or the fact that they re gonna have to go bankrupt over a treatable disease  I m kinda shocked that s what you picked up from the book lol   It s the power structure and the main players  people like Snow  who control things  And the upper class and bourgeoisie distract themselves with current fashions and material items and media  bread and circus  or Latin  pan et circum   the literally name of the place is Panem   which is exactly mirror our modern society  The work is also heavily influenced from the fall of Rome  which if you ve studied also correlates closely to what is happening in late capitalism  They lowered taxes on the wealthy  overspent on the military  sold political seats  and income inequality grew vastly     The working class works for low wages and ignores the fact that our health care is abhorrable so we can keep buying trendy bs and watch reality tv  That s the whole bread and circus philosophy we re kept entertained enough to be exploited    Anyways  if you even have to wonder about the actual intent of the author than she s not shy about her political leanings and is blatantly left  A quick visit to her Twitter shows that as well ;1018

13x4ss0jmjyy6o;13x4ss0;jmjyy6o;yawaworhtg;2.06.2023 01:00;1.0;That doesn t take account for the sociological limitations the Capitol faced  They knew very little world away from parties and the games  so when they had to step up and fight a war  they feel back on the Rube Goldberg inventiveness that really did prove to be a poor deterrent to a revolution  Even the peacekeepers seemed competent as a brutal police force  but not as an army  Though the capitol looked omnipotent compared to the districts  it looks like they may have had enough decadence to stagnate their ability to respond to problems  notwithstanding their direct and century developed processes toward creating the proper game traps  The last novel points to this  and it does not seem unreasonable as the natural trajectory of the series ;396

13x12mtjmetsxz;13x12mt;jmetsxz;ThusSpokeAnon;1.06.2023 00:05;20.0;Easily my favorite novel    I think in general the violence is much less explicit in the actual book than people act like it is  you can find so much more macabre content anywhere on a horror shelf  It s not like he s describing wounds in visceral detail again and again  There is violence frequently  yes  but it s generally glossed over like just another part of the terrain  Which is the point    And that s a quality that pervades everything about the book  total unity and harmony of the story  the language  the presentation  and even the author himself and his remote inaccessibility  It s like a book out of an alternate timeline where novelists shut themselves away for 15 years making highly researched and aesthetically uncompromising historical fiction that perfectly expresses a part of their soul and then somehow strike massive success with it  It s the secret dream of many authors and people who never became authors  I doubt anything quite like it will be produced again in our culture as many of the conditions that led to its creation no longer exist    As for the film  I certainly wish them luck  Many have called it unfilmable  but I think it will be extremely filmable  McCarthy writes like a camera ;913

13wq827jmer7qk;13wq827;jmer7qk;twoBrokenThumbs;31.05.2023 23:46;1.0;Sooo   the book is always better than the movie right   Just remember that     That being said  the secret of nimh is one of my favorite animated movies  It s a good movie overall  but it really is a gem of an animated feature   If you don t know who Don Bluth is  look him up ;2467
13wq827jmerw7c;13wq827;jmerw7c;Writerhowell;31.05.2023 23:51;1.0;It s such an amazing book  but my gosh  I was crying after I finished it   I know O Brien s daughter wrote some sequels  but I don t like to read sequels that weren t written by the original author   I ve never seen the movie  and I m quite disappointed that the trailer implies that it s gone from sci fi to fantasy   The book is definitely what I would consider very mild science fiction   I love animal stories   just finished reading  Bambi     but it also raises such interesting questions about ethics and societal structure   Anyway  I m so glad to see that someone on here has read  Mrs Frisby and the Rats of NIMH    I keep encouraging my mother to read it  but she hasn t yet   I think too many people dismiss children s books as not worth reading  but they can be SO MUCH BETTER than adults  books ;516

13wn2hajmcopn0;13wn2ha;jmcopn0;minimalist_coach;31.05.2023 15:49;15.0;My impression is she is the murderer  she didn t need to read murder mysteries  she learned everything she needed to know from nature  There was something about fireflies luring others in to kill them and other hints  During the trial  the prosecution seemed to think the timeline was possible although barely  Because she was not formally educated most people discounted her intelligence  and she never denied she killed him  she just chose to remain quiet ;2115

13wn2hajmdhl7i;13wn2ha;jmdhl7i;mortuarybarbue;31.05.2023 18:49;2.0;I think she did it  I think she knew he had to die when he attempted to rape her and said she belonged to him  She said he would never stop and she was probably right  So she planned it out and thought about it for a long time  And yes I believe she disguised herself and used the tides in her favor and knew exactly how to lure Chase to the tower ;394
13wn2hajmf16ix;13wn2ha;jmf16ix;FashionableBookworm;1.06.2023 01:00;2.0;I read it three years ago so my recollection of the details right now is very fuzzy but yes the ending implies that she did it  For what is worth is was really character assassination that completely ruined the book for me  It means the is a cold blooded killer who planned all this exactly as the detectives said  I don t understand how people gloss over it and still love the character and the book  It isn t girl power if you kill someone in a premeditated way ;1952
13wn2hajmf8of3;13wn2ha;jmf8of3;flygalmarielle;1.06.2023 01:56;2.0;I definitely think she did it  I thought it could have been Tate but then I realized that he never knew about the rape  unless I missed that part  I had covid when I read it     Also  the detectives go to her house and take the red cap  However  in the part of the book where her and Tate are throwing the hat back and forth to each other in the boats  he s the one who ends up with the hat in his boat and they don t see each other again until after the murder  unless I missed something     Also  she left 0 DNA at the scene with that long hair    My last qualm is the way SHE died  Relatively young and randomly in her boat  It felt like an abrupt end    Overall I did enjoy the read and am happy her and Tate ended up together ;1764

13wn2hajnhj41w;13wn2ha;jnhj41w;kbattlee;9.06.2023 03:44;2.0;This is such a good discussion  However  the poems about nature throughout the book consistently set up this scene  Kya was a woman of nature and learned everything about life from nature  I ve seen some argue that they were disappointed in the fact that she was guilty but people have to understand that this girl was an observer and a scientist    she learned from her surroundings aka  survival of the fittest   It s been a while since I ve read but I remember I read through a second time and all of the poems had me going   ooooohhhhhhh that totally makes sense now   I remember there was a poem about fireflies disguising themselves and the poem about the mantis and after reading it again  everything about the poems just finally made sense and I wanted to kick myself for not seeing it before lol  Most of the people around her discarded her as being just the marsh girl and having no intelligence when she was actually highly intelligent and very capable because she was so observant and familiar with the marsh  Also  if I m not mistaken  when Tate and Kya are in the woods and she s avoiding the social services man  I m pretty sure it s noted that she covers her tracks in some sort of way and that s a huge foreshadowing piece  Something along those lines happened ;567
13wn2hajmd4gaz;13wn2ha;jmd4gaz;Jekyllhyde;31.05.2023 17:27;1.0;I think the ending shows she definitely did it  How she did it is up to the reader ;2062
13wn2hajmgixcc;13wn2ha;jmgixcc;traceylclarke;1.06.2023 10:29;1.0;I think it is strongly implied that she did it  It is even more overtly shown in the movie ;1055
13wn2hajmgv5qg;13wn2ha;jmgv5qg;maafna;1.06.2023 12:31;1.0;Yeah  the ending didn t make sense to me  How did she get Chase to even meet her there in that exact time ;1351

13wn2hajmdbvkf;13wn2ha;jmdbvkf;Dependent_Fun_2665;31.05.2023 18:13;3.0;Thank you for bringing this up  I just remembered that in the passage about the fireflies there actually was an mention of insects using disguises  which would make the bus disguises make more explicit sense ;1999

13wn2hajmdafyt;13wn2ha;jmdafyt;Dependent_Fun_2665;31.05.2023 18:04;3.0;This is one of my primary questions too  I suppose all the provided information implies that she planned it out thoroughly in advance  and that would have included giving him an invite to meet her there ahead of time  I just find it somewhat odd how all of this needs to be assumed by the reader in order to make the storyline make sense  It seems pretty plothole ish  It would have made more sense if there was more explicit foreshadowing or postshadowing  or natural world metaphors    That being said  I did realize that the use of disguises in the insect world was mentioned  which adds weight to how she presumably disguised herself on the train ;361
13wn2hajmgvd33;13wn2ha;jmgvd33;maafna;1.06.2023 12:33;1.0;Exactly  We re to understand that if either he or the bus was five minutes late it wouldn t have worked but she was an extreme criminal mastermind ;702
13wn2hajmdfbq9;13wn2ha;jmdfbq9;Dependent_Fun_2665;31.05.2023 18:35;1.0;I actually wondered about the relation of her personal life to the novel given the  If I Did It  nature of the plotline after I heard she was suspected of murder  though I didn t look into the case at all  The  If I Did It  ness is what struck me as a strange    it s just a strange way to write a book    so when I heard she was a suspect in a case  I thought it might be her making sense of that incident in some way  whether she was actually involved or not   Very  If I Did It   is a fantastic way of putting it ;84

13wn2hajmhicp9;13wn2ha;jmhicp9;Dependent_Fun_2665;1.06.2023 15:17;1.0;Yes  you are correct  there was no clear indication that Tate knew about the rape   And wow  good point about the red cap    I just found the passage       Here  at least take my cap   and he tossed a red ski cap toward her  She caught it and slung it back to him  He threw it again  farther  and she jogged across the sandbar  leaned low and scooped it up  Laughing  she jumped into her boat  cranked the motor  and  as she boated near him  pitched the hat back into his boat  He grinned and she giggled  Then they stopped laughing and simply looked at each other as they lobbed the cap back and forth until she motored around the bend     I thought he ended up with the cap too  because that s the last boat it is explicitly stated it ends up in  but actually it s ambiguous  Apparently they re just looking at each other throwing the cap back and forth    Very good point about the hair as well    I also found the ending super abrupt  Honestly I was really upset by the whole ending  it kinda broke my brain  lol ;1126
13wn2hajmdoazw;13wn2ha;jmdoazw;minimalist_coach;31.05.2023 19:31;6.0;I kinda feel that is a major point of the book was learning behavior from nature for survival and how her actions were very practical and not muddied by moral dilemmas ;1262
13wn2hajmhg3kj;13wn2ha;jmhg3kj;Dependent_Fun_2665;1.06.2023 15:02;1.0;This is EXACTLY my line of reasoning and why it bothered me so much and    why I was struggling so hard to accept her as the murderer  I actually    think her being the murderer is a fantastic twist  if a bit jarring    I    can appreciate a complicated character  and it really could have been    tied up beautifully and hauntingly  But like you said  the timeline    doesn t make logical sense  I understand that we re supposed to believe    she learned to do all this from observing nature  but it s too much of a    logical leap for me  She s presented as a fairly socially naive    character  who struggles with situations involving other people  many of    which were required to execute the murder as she did   Her killing of    Chase wasn t purely instinctual in its execution  It s not that he was    there and she struck  It was absolutely assassin like  And yes  there was mention    of the manipulative tactics of female insects in mating rituals  and the    use of disguises in them as well    but there were no motifs or scenes    that showed Kya was garnering the tactical skills of a trained assassin    through her observations of nature  Maybe if there was  I would have an    easier time believing it  But even then    5 minutes ;231

13wg0mgjmcv95u;13wg0mg;jmcv95u;TaliesinMerlin;31.05.2023 16:30;2.0;I wrote an entire long comment about this article elsewhere  The gist is that I think the article would benefit from a longer perspective that considered popular poetry across time and what  if anything  makes this poetry different    The first two paragraphs set up a false binary between a traditional and  post modern way of reading poetry  In the first  we appreciate depths  meanings  and subtext  in the second  we appreciate  shitty maudlin  verse  No attention is given to the fact that the most often publicized poetry in the 16th through the 18th century was on broadsides and would have certainly qualified as doggerel or  shitty  verse   Think ballads  often salacious  Curious  See Wikipedia or the UCSB archive   There was also a vast amount of occasional verse circulating between people in local communities  as increased literacy led to an earlier  democratization  of verse  Most verse wasn t written by the likes of John Donne  Anne Bradstreet  or William Wordsworth but by anonymous broadside authors and ho hum epistolaries  Also  while earlier readers certainly had a vocabulary to appreciate good poetry  valuing poetry for  depth  or  subtext  only really came to the fore with the New Critics in the 20th century  Criticism before that was often more centered on other qualities like  brilliance  or expression or moral refinement  Depth for depth s sake is relatively recent as a key aesthetic criterion   I do think there is a point in how the popular poetry right now is distinct  namely in valuing minimalism and plain language  accessible in quick reading  The older doggerel may have also been accessible  but minimalism in ephemera seems new  The unmetered  unrhymed line break has become a dominant mode  rather than the trimeter and tetrameter quatrains of yore  The best parts of the article at least gesture at this difference   But  curiously  the only older art form the author reaches for is haiku  in a way that doesn t even recognize the larger situation of that tradition  the longer narratives of Basho that would then build in haiku as reflective puncta  There is very little other reflection for distinguishing why today s bad poetry is uniquely bad or uniquely a threat  There is no history of reading poetry reflected here  no nuance deeper than an interview soundbite about who might be served well or poorly by this poetry  As a result  the piece feels loaded to appeal only to those who are already opposed to the democratization of poetry  and it adds little new information or perspective ;2082

13wg0mgjmf013u;13wg0mg;jmf013u;Alaira314;1.06.2023 00:52;1.0;So this conversation is often framed as appreciation vs appropriation  with appreciation being good and appropriation being bad   Technically  both are forms of appropriation hence discussions of good appropriation and bad appropriation   but for the purposes of this post being easy to read I m going to use the term appropriation to mean only the bad kind  Just know that   technically   any time you re drawing from a cultural tradition that isn t your own  it s still appropriation   When you appreciate a cultural tradition food  game  art  clothes  etc   you approach primarily from a place of learning  You benefit by experiencing joy  but it s a joy that centers and respects the cultural context of whatever you re appreciating  Appreciation or good appropriation  seeks to be accurate  contextualized  and respects how members of the culture ask for the tradition to be shared or  not  shared    When you appropriate  on the other hand  you approach primarily from a desire to possess  You would like to consume or use that awesome tradition for yourself  You might not particularly care about accuracy or context  particularly if you re not first in line in the telephone chain and are copying someone else s appropriation  You re entirely concerned with  your  experience with this tradition  the desires of those in the culture it came from be damned   The haiku situation is  unfortunately  an appropriation rather than an appreciation  I think most people perpetuating it at this point mean well  and might not even know  I certainly didn t  But it s bad because so many people are going around with this misleading idea of what a Japanese haiku even  is   divorced from the cultural context surrounding it to the point where they think it s simplistic  That s not appreciation  and it s a problem  If we re going to be this shoddy about it  we shouldn t be using haiku in elementary school  Save it for a later grade when students can appreciate the context  and teach it properly from a place of learning and cultural respect ;350
